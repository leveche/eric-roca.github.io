This paper examines how the degree of gender-egalitarianism embedded in inheritance rules impacts state building. Male-biased inheritance rules historically maximise the likelihood of dynastic continuity. However, there is more landmerging under gender-egalitarian rules. We compare both types of inheritance rules, concluding that, contrary to the literature, gender-egalitarian norms promote state capacity in the short run more than gender-biased norms. In the long run results are reversed.","tags":["Gender Equality","Theoretical Model"],"title":"In the Name of the Father: Inheritance Systems and the Dynamics of State Capacity","type":"working_papers"},{"authors":["Annalisa Frigo","Eric Roca Fernandez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1548851400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548851400,"objectID":"f49ffbefe42e160a3a39c84b8089fbcb","permalink":"https://eric-roca.github.io/talk/2019-01_marseille/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2019-01_marseille/","section":"talk","summary":"This papers shows the long-lasting effects of the beguine movement on gender equality.

Using data from sub-Saharan regions, it advances that maternal job-taking varies with the mortality risk premium it poses to children. Reductions in maternal employment are sizeable and reach 5.6 percentage points among affluent families in more developed areas. We do not find such evidence among poor households, suggesting financial constraints may impede trading off maternal income against children safety. The effect we document applies only to families with under-five infants. We introduce a theoretical model rationalising our findings.

It proposes and empirically assesses a new class of determinants of gender equality: increases in women's bargaining power through reductions in the cost of remaining single. In particular, enlarging women's options besides marriage \u0026mdash;even if only temporarily\u0026mdash; increases their bargaining power with respect to men, leading to a persistent improvement in gender equality. We illustrate this mechanism focusing on the specific Belgian context, and relate gender-equality levels in the 19th century to the presence of medieval, female-only communities called _beguinages_ that allowed women to remain single amidst a society that advocated the opposite. Combining precise beguinages' location with 19th-century census data, we document that beguinages were instrumental in decreasing the gender gap in literacy.","tags":["Gender Equality","Economic History","Empirical Work"],"title":"Roots of Gender Equality: the Persistent Effect of Beguinages on Attitudes Toward Women","type":"working_papers"},{"authors":["Eric Roca Fernandez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1488463200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488463200,"objectID":"fa52df73c3dced26870a3b85f2f06819","permalink":"https://eric-roca.github.io/talk/2017-02_providence_2/","publishdate":"2017-02-02T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2017-02_providence_2/","section":"talk","summary":"We analyse how inheritance rules affect rulers' willingness to invest in state capacity.
