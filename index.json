Reductions in maternal employment are sizeable and reach 5.6 percentage points among affluent families in more developed areas. We do not find such evidence among poor households, suggesting financial constraints may impede trading off maternal income against children safety.

In the specific context of Belgium, it relates higher levels of gender equality during the 19th century to the presence of medieval, female-only, Belgian communities called beguinages. Combining a novel, hand-collected data-set on beguinage location with 19th-century Belgian census data, we document that in municipalities where beguine communities settled the literacy gap reduced. Schooling was not compulsory and literacy differentials reflect parental tenets on gender equality. Using changes in the political organisation through which some villages became more attractive to beguines, we establish that the variation in gender literacy is indeed related to the presence of beguinages. Our results are in line with the extensive empirical evidence documenting the persistence of gender norms and culture. Finally, we propose a novel class of mechanisms, based on improvements in girls’ bargaining power, to rationalise our findings.","tags":["Gender Equality","Economic History","Empirical Work"],"title":"Roots of Gender Equality: the Persistent Effect of Beguinages on Attitudes Toward Women","type":"working_papers"},{"authors":["Èric Roca Fernández"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1485990000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1485990000,"objectID":"fa52df73c3dced26870a3b85f2f06819","permalink":"https://eric-roca.github.io/talk/2017-02_providence_2/","publishdate":"2017-02-02T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2017-02_providence_2/","section":"talk","summary":"We analyse how inheritance rules affect rulers' willingness to invest in state capacity.

We analyse an overlooked determinant of state capacity at its early stages. Based on a theoretical model, this paper advances that the degree of gender-egalitarianism embedded in inheritance rules affects state capacity. The model combines two forces that drive state capacity building as it permits to raise taxes and overcome rivals. It accommodates dynasties in its simplest form and introduces inter-state marriages of landed heirs. On the one hand, the idea of dynastic continuity, of utmost importance to European medieval rulers, directly encourages state building. On the other hand, a wealth effect that gains significance through marriages indirectly promotes it. Gender-biased inheritance rules favouring men incentivise state-building because, historically, men continued dynasties and it was valued. We weigh this effect against the indirect effect of more land-merging marriages under gender-egalitarian rules. Our results suggest that gender-egalitarian rules promote state capacity in the short run. This new result nuances the idea that higher probability of continued rule boosts state capacity. We also corroborate the importance of continued rule: in the long run, genderbiased rules gender-neutral norms. This provides a rationale for the pervasive European tradition of preferring men over women as heirs.","tags":["Gender Equality","Theoretical Model"],"title":"In the Name of the Father: Inheritance Systems and the Dynamics of State Capacity","type":"working_papers"}]
