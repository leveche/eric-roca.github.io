One of the main features of this model is that agents have an infinite horizon: they live forever and optimise considering an infinite horizon.\nThe overlapping generations model changes this hypothesis and focuses on the life-cycle: agents make decisions regarding how to consume, and how much to save for retirement. This is, the OLG model assumes that agents work until some age, and then retire.1 A focus of the OLG model is the intergenerational redistribution, allowing to study:\n social security, education policies and public debt.  The main departure with respect to the Ramsey model is that in OLG, agents are heterogeneous. Individuals live for two periods of time, and then die. In the first period, they are young and work. When old, they retire and live from savings. Hence, at any point in time, two types of agents with different budget constraints exist: young and adults.2\nAs we shall see, in this model the competitive path may not be optimal. Consequently, there may be instances in which the utility of all individuals can be increased. Therefore, the OLG model opens the door to government intervention, to reallocate consumption and savings efficiently.

To see this, take its typical form:\n$$f(x,y) = x^\\alpha y^{1-\\alpha}$$\nand verify that $f(\\lambda x, \\lambda y) = \\lambda f(x,y).$ Indeed, $f(\\lambda x, \\lambda y) = (\\lambda x)^{\\alpha} (\\lambda y)^{1-\\alpha} = \\lambda x^{\\alpha} y^{1-\\alpha} = \\lambda f(x,y).$\nExample: A CES production function\nA CES production function takes the form $f(x,y) = \\left(\\alpha x^{\\eta} + (1-\\alpha) y ^{\\eta}\\right)^{\\frac{\\zeta}{\\eta}},, \\eta \\leq 1.$ This type of function is homogeneous of degree $\\zeta:$\n$$f(\\lambda x, \\lambda y) = \\left(\\alpha \\lambda^{\\eta} x^{\\eta} + (1-\\alpha) \\lambda^{\\eta} y^{\\eta}\\right)^{\\frac{\\zeta}{\\eta}} = \\lambda^{\\zeta} f(x,y).$$\nProperties of the derivatives of homogeneous functions Assume that $f$ is continuously differentiable of as many degrees as required.\nThe derivative of a function homogeneous of degree $p$ is homogeneous of degree $p-1$.\nIf a function $f$ is of degree $p$, then for any $n = 1, \\ldots, N$ the partial derivative $\\partial f(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{N})/\\partial x_{n}$ is of degree $p-1.$\nNote: see proof in Mas-Colell et al.\nExamples:\n  A Cobb-Douglas production function $f(x,y) = x^{\\alpha} y^{1-\\alpha}$ has derivates equal to $f_{x}(x,y) = \\alpha x^{\\alpha-1} y^{1-\\alpha}$ and $f_{y}(x,y) = (1-\\alpha) x^{\\alpha} y^{-\\alpha}.$ Then it is easy to check that $$f_{x}(\\lambda x, \\lambda y) = \\lambda^{0} f_{x}(x,y)$$ and $$f_{y}(\\lambda x, \\lambda y) = \\lambda^{0} f_{y}(x,y),$$ which implies that derivatives are homogeneous of degree zero.\n  The CES function $f$: $f(x,y) = (\\alpha x^{\\eta} + (1-\\alpha) y^{\\eta})^{\\frac{\\zeta}{\\eta}}$ is homogeneous of degree $\\zeta$. The derivative function $f_{x}(x,y) = \\alpha \\zeta x^{\\eta - 1} (\\alpha x^{\\eta} + (1-\\alpha)y^{\\eta})^{\\frac{\\zeta-\\eta}{\\eta}}$ is homogeneous of degree $\\zeta-1$: $$f_{x}(\\lambda x, \\lambda y) = \\alpha \\zeta x^{\\eta - 1}\\lambda^{\\eta-1}(\\alpha \\lambda^{\\eta} x^{\\eta} + (1-\\alpha) \\lambda^{\\eta} y^{\\eta})^{\\frac{\\zeta-\\eta}{\\eta}} = \\lambda^{\\zeta-1} \\alpha \\zeta x^{\\eta - 1}(\\alpha x^{\\eta} + (1-\\alpha) y^{\\eta})^{\\frac{\\zeta-\\eta}{\\eta}} = \\lambda^{\\zeta-1} f_{x}(x,y).$$ We can proceed similarly for $y$.\n  Euler\u0026rsquo;s formula This is an interesting property of homogeneous functions. In particular, it is useful in showing that, if the production function is homogeneous of degree one and factors are paid their marginal product, then profits are zero.\nSuppose that $f(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{N})$ is homogeneous of degree $p$ and differentiable. So, at any set of values $(\\bar{x_{1}}, \\ldots, \\bar{x_{N}})$ we have:\n$$\\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\frac{\\partial f(\\bar{x_{1}}, \\ldots, \\bar{x_{N}})}{\\partial x_{n}} \\bar{x_{n}} = p f(\\bar{x_{1}}, \\ldots, x_{N}).$$\nIn words, if we multiply the derivatives by the variable with respect which we derivate and add all of them up, we retrieve the original function $p$ times. Setting $p=1$ delivers the property we announced before.\nExample\n If the production function is homogeneous of degree one, under perfect competition (factors are paid their marginal product) firms make zero profits: For simplicity, take a Cobb-Douglas function $$f(x,y)=x^{\\alpha} y^{1-\\alpha}.$$ Marginal products are $$f_{x} = \\alpha x^{\\alpha -1}y^{1-\\alpha}$$ and $$f_{y} = (1-\\alpha) x^{\\alpha} y^{-\\alpha}.$$ Applying Euler\u0026rsquo;s formula we get: $$f_{x} x + f_{y} y = \\alpha x^{\\alpha - 1} y^{1-\\alpha} x + (1-\\alpha) x^{\\alpha} y^{-\\alpha} y = f(x,y).$$ Hence, the total amount produced ($f(x,y)$) is distributed to factor owners, and the firm necessarily makes zero profits.  Applications to work with intensive-form functions Often, we express the production function $F(K,L)$ in intensive terms. This is, instead of focusing on the level of capital and labour, we are interested in the level of capital per worker. In other terms, we focus on $k \\equiv \\frac{K}{L}.$ Since we assume a production function of degree one, the transformation is simple. Remember that if we multiply both factors by the same number, the result is also multiplied by that same number. Hence, if we pick $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{L}$ we obtain:\n$$f(k) \\equiv F\\left(\\frac{K}{L}, \\frac{L}{L} \\right) = \\frac{1}{L} F\\left( K,L \\right).$$ Therefore, rearranging: $$F(K,L) = Lf(k).$$\nWe use this last relationship to compute the marginal products in intensive form: $$F_{K}(K,L) = \\frac{\\partial F(K,L)}{\\partial K} = \\frac{\\partial L f\\left(\\frac{K}{L} \\right)}{\\partial K} = L \\frac{1}{L}f_{k}(k) = f^{\\prime}(k).$$\nSimilarly: $$F_{L}(K,L) = \\frac{\\partial F(K,L)}{\\partial L} = \\frac{\\partial L f\\left(\\frac{K}{L}\\right)}{\\partial L} = f\\left(\\frac{K}{L}\\right)-Lf^{\\prime}\\left(\\frac{K}{L}\\right)\\frac{K}{L^{2}} = f(k) - f^{\\prime}(k)k.$$ Alternatively, we can use the Euler\u0026rsquo;s formula to compute $F_{L}(K,L)$. $$F(K,L) = F_{K} K + F_{L} L$$ hence, isolating $$F_{L} = \\frac{F(K,L) - F^{\\prime}_{K} K}{L}.$$ We know that $F(K,L)$ is homogeneous of degree one, hence $F\\left(\\frac{K}{L},1\\right) = \\frac{F(K,L)}{L}.$ Therefore, $$F_{L} = F\\left(\\frac{K}{L}\\right) - F^{\\prime}_{K}\\frac{K}{L} = f(k) - f^{\\prime}(k) k,$$ where we use the fact that $F^{\\prime}_{K}$ is homogeneous of degree zero ($F$ was homogeneous of degree one) and we can divide the arguments without changing the value of the function: $$F^{\\prime}(K,L) =F^{\\prime}\\left(\\frac{K}{L},\\frac{L}{L}\\right) = f^{\\prime}(k).$$\n","date":1562803200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562803200,"objectID":"15ff65123ee5f01ede756c34cd6d0d31","permalink":"https://eric-roca.github.io/courses/math_app/homogenous_functions/","publishdate":"2019-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/math_app/homogenous_functions/","section":"courses","summary":"Notes based on Appendix A.1.1 of de la Croix and Michel: A Theory of Economic Growth. and Appendix M.B of Mas-Colell, Whinston and Green: Microeconomic Theory.\nHomogeneity A function of N variables $f(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{N})$ defined for all non-negative values $(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{N})$ is homogeneous of degree $p$ if:","tags":null,"title":"Homogenous functions","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The economy is populated by a large number of identical households.

For simplicity, savings take the form of capital (instead of assets). Households lend capital to firms, obtaining a real interest $r_t$. However, capital is subject to a constant depreciation rate $\\delta$.\nTherefore, at each period of time, households face the following budget constraint:\n$$c_{t} + k_{t+1} = w_{t} + r_{t} k_{t} + (1-\\delta) k_{t}. \\tag{2, Budget C.}$$\nThe left-hand side represents expenditures during the period $t$:\n Consumption Saving  The right-hand side includes all sources of income:\n Wages Interests Remaining capital after depreciation  Effectively, households can eat capital    Note: The budget constraint could have included dividends $d_{t}$ on the right-hand side. However, as we shall see, firms operate in perfect competition, and make zero profits.\nSolving the household\u0026rsquo;s problem First, we assume that households have perfect foresight. This means that a household is able to perfectly forecast all the future values of the relevant variables when deciding. For instance, at time $t$ the household is able to correctly compute $r_{t+1}$ and $w_{t+1}.$\nAssumption R2: Households have perfect foresight.\nWe are interested in finding the optimal consumption and savings path, this is, the one that yields maximum utility. Note that the problem is infinite, in the sense that we need to determine $c_{t}$ and $k_{t+1}$ for each and every period of time. From the perspective of a household, the intertemporal maximisation problem reads:\n$$\\begin{eqnarray} \u0026amp;\\max_{c_{t}, k_{t+1}} \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\beta^{t} u(c_{t}) \\\\\\\n\u0026amp; c_{t} + k_{t+1} = w_{t} + r_{t} k_{t} + (1- \\delta) k_{t} \\forall t\\geq0. \\end{eqnarray}$$\n First, we write the Langrangian equation corresponding to the problem:\n$$\\mathcal{L} = \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\beta^t u(c_{t}) + \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\lambda_{t}(w_{t} + r_{t}k_{t} + (1-\\delta)k_{t} - c_{t} - k_{t+1}).$$\nNote: this Lagrangian has infinite multipliers $\\lambda_{t},$ one for each period.\nAt time $t$, households have two decisions to make:\n How much to consume at $t$: $c_{t}$ How much to save at $t$: $k_{t+1}$  Therefore, we derive the Lagrangian function with respect to $c_{t}$ and $k_{t+1}$.\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial c_{t}} = \\beta^{t} u^{\\prime}(c_{t}) - \\lambda_{t}$$ $$\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial k_{t+1}} = - \\lambda_{t} + \\lambda_{t+1}(r_{t+1}+(1-\\delta))$$\nSetting both expressions equal to zero to obtain the maximum and combining them yields:\n$$u^{\\prime}(c_{t}) = \\beta u^{\\prime}(c_{t+1})(r_{t+1}+1-\\delta). \\tag{3, Euler Eq.}$$\nThis condition is called the Euler equation. It tells us the optimal behaviour of the household. Rearranging the expression a little bit, we are left with a clearer expression linking present and future consumption:\n$$\\frac{u^{\\prime}(c_{t})}{u^{\\prime}(c_{t+1})} = \\beta (r_{t+1} + 1 - \\delta). \\tag{3.1, Euler eq.}$$\nSlightly more complex relationships can arise if the population grows or there is technological progress, see Romer, Chapter 2.\nThe Euler equation The Euler equation often appears in optimisation problems: either using discrete or continuous time. The discrete-time version is relatively easier to interpret and obtain. In our case, the Euler equation relates the present and future marginal utilities of consumption. Imagine that the household decreased the amount consumed today, $c_{t}$ by an infinitesimally small amount $\\Delta_{c_{t}}$. This causes a utility loss of $\\Delta_{c_{t}} u^{\\prime}(c_{t})$. Saving $\\Delta_{c_{t}}$ until tomorrow and consuming all the proceedings generates a utility gain of $\\Delta_{c_{t}}(r_{t+1} + 1 - \\delta) u^{\\prime}(c_{t+1})$. This gain must be, of course, discounted using the rate $\\beta$ to compare present-day equivalents.\nSince the household is optimising, both the loss and the gain must be equal, otherwise, there would be an alternative consumption level that would maximise utility. Hence, putting everything together: $\\Delta_{c_{t}} u^{\\prime}(c_{t}) = \\beta \\Delta_{c_{t}} (r_{t+1} + 1 - \\delta) u^{\\prime}(c_{t+1}).$ Cancel $\\Delta_{c_{t}} \u0026gt; 0$ on both sides to obtain the Euler equation. Alternatively, we can interpret the Euler equation as stating that it is not optimal to slightly deviate from the optimal path, consuming slightly less for instance, and later returning to the optimal path. Remark: the scheme we are putting in place here does not modify the intertemporal budget constraint because all the additional proceedings from savings are consumed.\nThe Transversality Condition The Euler equation is not enough to fully determine the optimal sequence of consumption and savings. For the moment, trajectories where capital or consumption grows boundedless are feasible, but these should not be optimal.\n First, consider the economy continuously accumulates capital. In that case, consumption must decrease towards zero. Since we have assumed that $\\lim_{c \\rightarrow 0}u^{\\prime}( c )=+\\infty$ (Inada condition) a small increase in consumption raises utility by a large amount, this is, the marginal utility of consumption is very large. Hence, it cannot be optimal to accumulate capital and let consumption go to zero. Alternatively, let savings vanish. This case typically implies that $k_{t}$ converges to zero in finite time (this is, for some $t\u0026lt;\\infty$). The condition that capital must be positive prevents such cases.  Note: the preceding points are only descriptive of what the transversality condition implies.\nIn fact, that transversality condition reads as:\n$$\\lim_{t \\rightarrow \\infty} \\beta^{t}u^{\\prime}(c_{t})k_{t+1} = 0. \\tag{4, Trans. Cond.}$$\nIn general, we will obtain a steady-state equilibrium in which the path of capital and consumption are bounded. This is, in the optimal solution, consumption $c_{t} \\rightarrow c^{\\star}$ and capital $k_{t} \\rightarrow k^{\\star}$.

These can either be in continuous or discrete time. In this note, we focus only on the discrete-time case, but the intuition carries over to the continuous case. When equations are in discrete time, we call time difference equations. The continuous-time equivalents are called differential equations. Note: the conditions for stability change between the continuous and discrete-time cases.\nA dynamic equation: one-dimensional case A dynamic equation is an equation that relates the state of a variable through time to the value the variable took in previous periods. The number of lags the equation considers determines its order. A difference equation of order $T$ takes the form $$x_{t+1} = f(x_{t}, x_{t-1}, \\ldots, x_{t-T}).$$\nFirst-order difference equation One of the most common cases that arises in macroeconomic models is the first-order difference equation. It relates the present value of a variable to the value it took in the period immediately before:\n$$x_{t+1} = f(x_{t}).$$\nWe are often interested in the steady state of difference equations. The steady state is defined as the set of values $\\bar{x}$ (there can be more than one steady state) such that, if reached, the economy remains there. Equivalently, once reached, the value of the variable $x$ remains unchanged. Mathematically, $\\bar{x}$ is a steady state of a first-order difference equation if\n$$\\bar{x} = f(\\bar{x}).$$\nProving that a steady state $\\bar{x}$ exists may involve using different techniques.\nExample: Assume the following first-order difference equation:\n$$x_{t+1} = x_{t}^{\\eta} +\\kappa, \\kappa\u0026gt;0, \\eta \\in (0,1).$$\nThe steady state solves: $\\bar{x} = \\bar{x}^{\\eta}+\\kappa$.\nTo show that it exists we can prove that the function $F(\\bar{x}) = \\bar{x} - \\bar{x}^{\\eta} - \\kappa$ as at least one root. Note that $F(0) = -\\kappa \u0026lt;0$ and that $\\lim_{\\bar{x} \\rightarrow +\\infty} F(\\bar{x}) = + \\infty.$ Hence, since it is a continuous function, it must have at least one solution. We can further show that it admits one and only one solution by proving that $x_{t+1}$ is a monotonous function of $x_{t}$. Monotonicity is the key here, not whether it increases or decreases, although in our case it is increasing.\n$$\\frac{\\partial x_{t+1}}{\\partial x_{t}} = \\eta x_{t}^{\\eta-1} \u0026gt; 0.$$\nHence, the function is monotonous (always increasing) and there is one and only one root.\nStability of a first-order difference equation A steady state solution $\\bar{x}$ to $\\bar{x} = f(\\bar{x})$ which is interior to the domain of $f$ is locally stable if for any initial value $x_{0}$ near enough to $\\bar{x}$, the dynamics starting from $x_{0}$ converge to $\\bar{x}$. In other terms, $$\\lim_{t \\rightarrow +\\infty} x_{t} = \\bar{x}.$$\nTo determine whether a steady state is stable we analyse whether the function converges towards that steady state. We typically use first-order conditions to determine the stability. However, these only apply to hyperbolic steady states.\nHyperbolic steady states Assume that $f$ is differentiable. Let $\\bar{x}$ be a steady state of $f$.\n If $|f^{\\prime}(\\bar{x}) = 1|,$ then the steady state is non-hyperbolic. If $|f^{\\prime}(\\bar{x}) \\neq 1|,$ then the steady state is hyperbolic.  First-order stability Suppose that $\\bar{x}$ is a hyperbolic steady state of $f$. Then\n if $|f^{\\prime}(\\bar{x})| \u0026lt; 1$ then $\\bar{x}$ is locally stable, if $|f^{\\prime}(\\bar{x})| \u0026gt; 1$ then $\\bar{x}$ is unstable.  Page 316 of de la Croix and Michel provides the proof.\nIntuitively, the condition for stability requires that we approach the steady state slowly. In other terms, the curvature of $f$ is smaller than 1. Therefore, although $x_{t}$ grows over time, every time the increase in its value becomes smaller, eventually tending towards zero.\nExample: let $x_{t} = f(x_{t-1}) = x_{t-1}^{0.5}$. This first-order difference equation has two steady states: $\\bar{x}_{1} = 0$ and $\\bar{x}_{2} = 1.$ The first derivative is $f^{\\prime} = 0.5 x_{t-1}^{-0.5}.$ Evaluating it at the steady states results in the following:\n$$ \\lim_{\\bar{x} \\rightarrow {\\bar{x}_{1}}^{+}} |f^{\\prime}(\\bar{x}_{1})| = + \\infty, $$ $$ |f^{\\prime}(\\bar{x}_{2})| = 0.5 \u0026lt; 1.$$\nTherefore, $\\bar{x}_{1}= 0$ is an unstable steady state, while $\\bar{x}_{2} = 1$ is stable. Below, we plot two trajectories of $x_{t}$ when $x_{t} = x_{t-1}^{0.5}:$ one starting below the steady state $x_{0} \u0026lt; 1$ and the other above.\nStarting from $x_{0} \u0026lt; \\bar{x}_{2}$, the variable slowly increases until it reaches the steady state $\\bar{x}_{2}.$ Notice how the curvature of the function decreases (and is smaller than one), generating the convergence. We can reason similarly for the case $x_{0} \u0026gt; \\bar{x}_{2}.$\nFirst-order systems of difference equations A system of first-order difference equations takes the form:\n$$\\begin{eqnarray} x^{1}_{t+1} \u0026amp; = f^{1}(x^{1}_{t}, \\ldots, x^{N}_{t}), \\\\\\\n\\vdots \u0026amp; \\\\\\\nx^{N}_{t+1} \u0026amp; = f^{N}(x^{1}_{t}, \\ldots, x^{N}_{t}). \\end{eqnarray}$$\nAs before, we often interested by the steady states of first-order systems of difference equations. Finding a steady state implies solving the system for a fixed point $(\\bar{x}^{1}, \\ldots, \\bar{x}^{N})$ such that\n$$\\begin{eqnarray} \\bar{x}^{1} \u0026amp; = f^{1}( \\bar{x}^{1}, \\ldots, \\bar{x}^{N}), \\\\\\\n\\vdots \u0026amp; \\\\\\\n\\bar{x}^{N} \u0026amp; = f^{N}( \\bar{x}^{1}, \\ldots, \\bar{x}^{N}). \\end{eqnarray}$$\nExample: suppose the following system of first-order difference equations:\n$$\\begin{eqnarray} x_{t} \u0026amp; = 0.3x_{t-1} + y_{t-1}^{0.5}, \\\\\ny_{t} \u0026amp; = x_{t-1} - 0.5y_{t-1}. \\end{eqnarray}$$\nFinding the steady states requires solving the system of equations:\n$$\\begin{eqnarray} \\bar{x} \u0026amp; = 0.3 \\bar{x} + \\bar{y}^{0.5}, \\\\\\\n\\bar{y} \u0026amp; = \\bar{x} - 0.5 \\bar{y}. \\end{eqnarray}$$\nThe system has two solutions: $(\\bar{x}_{1}, \\bar{y}_{1}) = (0,0)$ and $(\\bar{x}_{2}, \\bar{y}_{2}) = (1.36, 0.90).$\nStability of a first-order system of difference equations Let the functions $f^{1}(\\cdot), \\ldots, f^{N}(\\cdot)$ be differentiable and let $(\\bar{x}^{1}, \\ldots, \\bar{x}^{N})$ be a steady state of the dynamic system. Moreover, assume the steady state is interior on the domain $\\mathcal{J}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}.$ The steady state is locally stable if for any initial value $(x^{1}_{0}, \\ldots, x^{N}_{0})$ near enough to $(\\bar{x}^{1}, \\ldots, \\bar{x}^{N})$ the dynamics of $(x^{1}_{0}, \\ldots, x^{N}_{0})$ converge to $(\\bar{x}^{1}, \\ldots, \\bar{x}^{N}).$\nIt may be difficult to assess whether the previous condition applies. Note: de la Croix and Michel provide a more technical version on pages 320\u0026ndash;321. Instead, we can analyse the stability of the system using a first-order Taylor approximation around the steady state and applying a technique similar to what we used for the single-equation case.\nFirst, a first-order Taylor approximation of $f^{1}$ around the steady state is given by\n$$f^{1}(x^{1}, \\ldots, x^{N}) - f^{1}(\\bar{x}^{1}, \\ldots, \\bar{x}^{N}) \\simeq \\sum_{i=1}^{N} {f^{1}_{i}}^{\\prime}(\\bar{x}^{1}, \\ldots, \\bar{x}^{N})(x^{i} - \\bar{x}^{i}),$$\nand similarly for $f^{2}(\\cdot), \\ldots, f^{N}(\\cdot).$ We can express these in matrix notation:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} x^{1}_{t+1} - x^{1}_{t} \\\\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\\\nx^{N}_{t+1} - x^{N}_{t} \\end{pmatrix} = \\bar{A} \\begin{pmatrix} x^{1}_{t} - \\bar{x}^{1} \\\\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\\\nx^{N}_{t} - \\bar{x}^{N} \\end{pmatrix}, $$ where $\\bar{A}$ is an $N \\times N$ matrix of the derivatives of $f^{1}(\\cdot), \\ldots, f^{N}(\\cdot)$ taken at the point $(\\bar{x}^{1}, \\ldots, \\bar{x}^{N})^{\\prime},$ called Jacobian matrix:\n$$\\bar{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} {f^{1}_{x_{1}}}^{\\prime}(\\bar{x}^{1}, \\ldots, \\bar{x}^{N}) \u0026amp; \\ldots \u0026amp; {f^{1}_{x_{N}}}^{\\prime}(\\bar{x}^{1}, \\ldots, \\bar{x}^{N}) \\\\\\\n\\vdots \u0026amp; \\vdots \u0026amp; \\vdots \\\\\\\n{f^{N}_{x_{1}}}^{\\prime}(\\bar{x}^{1}, \\ldots, \\bar{x}^{N}) \u0026amp; \\ldots \u0026amp; {f^{N}_{x_{N}}}^{\\prime}(\\bar{x}^{1}, \\ldots, \\bar{x}^{N}) \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNote: the matrix $\\bar{A}$ is evaluated at the steady state $(\\bar{x}^{1}, \\ldots, \\bar{x}^{N})$.\nHyperbolicity of the hyperplane Assume that functions $f^{1}(\\cdot), \\ldots, f^{N}(\\cdot)$ are continuously differentiable in $\\mathcal{J}$. Let $(\\bar{x}^{1}, \\ldots, \\bar{x}^{N})$ be a steady state in $\\mathcal{J}.$ If the moduli of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian are different from 1 $(|\\lambda_{1}| \\neq 1, \\ldots, |\\lambda_{N} \\neq 1),$ then the steady state is hyperbolic. If any of the eigenvalues equals 1, then the steady state is non-hyperbolic.\nHowever, even if the steady state is non-hyperbolic, adequately choosing the initial conditions for the control variables can put it in a saddle-path trajectory, this is, one that leads to the steady state. In that case, we need some eigenvalues to be within the unit circle: $(-1,1).$\nA steady state is stable if all the eigenvalues associated to the Jacobian matrix are inside the unit circle $(-1,1).$ This is, if we denote the eigenvalues by $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2,\\ldots, \\lambda_N,$ the steady state is stable if and only if $\\lambda_i \\in (-1,1), i=1,\\ldots,N.$\nIn many economic applications we often find that one eigenvalue is outside the unit circle. Blanchard-Kahn characterises the types of steady states.\n Blanchard-Kahn conditions Denote by $l$ the number of eigenvalues in the unit circle, and denote by $m$ the number of pre-determined state variables:  if $l=m$ (standard case): saddle-path, unique optimal trajectory. The eigenvalues within the unit circle govern the speed of convergence. if $l \\lt m$: unstable if $l \\gt m$: multiple optimal trajectories.   One important type is the saddle path. In such case, there is only one initial configuration of variables such that the economy converges towards the steady state. Any other initial set of values delivers a non-converging trajectory. In economics, we often encounter a $2 \\times 2$ system. Often, the initial value of one variable is fixed (state variable, in general capital). Hence, we have to select the value of the other variable (control variable, in general consumption) in such a way that it is on the saddle path.\nWe develop a full example in Example.\n","date":1562803200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562803200,"objectID":"15a609a9a48916644cc19df91bf9c241","permalink":"https://eric-roca.github.io/courses/math_app/steady_state/","publishdate":"2019-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/math_app/steady_state/","section":"courses","summary":"This note is based on Appendix A.3.2 of de la Croix and Michel: A Theory of Economic Growth.\nMacroeconomic models often have dynamic equations relating different periods of time.

As before, we assume perfect foresight for individuals. Assumption OLG.1 Individuals have perfect foresight.\nWhen young, they are endowed with one unit of labour that they supply inestastically. Assumption OLG.2 Individuals supply one unit of labour inelastically when young. They receive the ongoing wage rate $w_{t}$ and allocate this income between:\n current consumption $c_{t}$, savings $s_{t}$ that are invested in the firms.  Therefore, the budget constraint of a young individual in period $t$ is:\n$$ w_{t} = c_{t} + s_{t}.$$\nOnce an individual reaches old age the next period, he consumes his savings (plus the interest rate received), reproduces \u0026mdash;exogenous fertility at rate $n$\u0026mdash; and dies. Old people do not care about anything happening after death. Therefore, an agent has one unique choice:\n consumption when adult, $d_{t+1}.$  The budget constraint for this period is:1\n$$s_{t}(1 - \\delta + r_{t+1}) = d_{t+1}.$$\nwith $\\delta \\in (0,1)$ being the capital depreciation rate.\nHence, an individual faces two budget constraints. However, we can collapse both into a unique intertemporal budget constraint.\nThe intertemporal budget constraint In the economy, we have consumption as the numeraire. It is more convenient for us to combine the two budget constraints corresponding to young and old ages into one single constraint. Starting from\n$$\\left. \\begin{eqnarray} w_{t} = c_{t} + s_{t} \\\\\\\nd_{t+1} = s_{t}(1 - \\delta + r_{t+1}) = s_{t} R_{t+1} \\end{eqnarray} \\right\\}.$$\nwhere $R_{t} \\equiv 1 - \\delta + r_{t+1}$ represents the return on savings, isolate $s_{t}$ in the second equation and plug it in the first one:\n$$ w_{t} = c_{t} + \\frac{d_{t+1}}{R_{t+1}}. \\tag{1, Int. Budget Const.} \\label{eq:budget}$$\nThe intertemporal budget constraint indicates that the total present value of income ($w_{t}$, the only source of income) equals the total present value of expenditures. The present value of consumption when old $d_{t+1}$ is discounted using the interest rate $R_{t+1}.$\nIt is clear that savings, as usual, will be a function of wages $w$ and interests $R.$ So will consumption at all periods of time.\nUtility function We suppose that the life-cycle utility function is additively separable:\n$$U(c,d) = u( c ) + \\beta u(d),, \\beta \\in(0,1) \\tag{2, Utility} \\label{eq:utility}$$\nwhere $\\beta \\in (0,1)$ is the psychological discount factor. We assume that $u( c )$ has the properties\nAssumption OLG.3\n OLG.3.1 $u^{\\prime}( c ) \u0026gt; 0,$ OLG.3.2 $u^{\\prime \\prime} ( c ) \u0026lt; 0,$ OLG.3.3 $ \\lim_{c \\rightarrow 0} u^{\\prime}( c) = +\\infty.$  The last assumption $\\lim_{c \\rightarrow 0} u^{\\prime}( c ) = +\\infty$ implies that an individual will always have a positive consumption \u0026mdash;as long as he has enough income to finance it.\nAnother important implication of the choice of the utility formulation is that $c$ and $d$ are normal goods: the demand is not decreasing in wealth. It follows from additive separability and concavity. In the Appendix we discuss it in more detail for a non-separable utility function.\nThe behaviour of individuals At time $t$, young individuals receive their wages, consume and save while maximising the utility function.\n$$\\begin{eqnarray} \u0026amp; \\max u(c_{t}) + \\beta u(d_{t+1}) \\\\\\\n\u0026amp; \\mathrm{s.t.} \\quad w_{t} = c_{t} + s_{t} \\\\\\\n\u0026amp; \\phantom{s.t.} \\quad d_{t+1} = R_{t+1}s_{t} \\\\\\\n\u0026amp; \\phantom{s.t.} \\quad c_{t} \\geq 0, d_{t+1} \\geq 0. \\end{eqnarray}$$\nWe have two possibilities to solve this problem:\nSubstitution First, we can substitute $c_{t}$ and $d_{t+1}$ in the utility function, leading to:\n$$u(w_{t} - s_{t}) + \\beta u(R_{t+1}s_{t}).$$\nThis function is strictly concave with respect to $s_{t}$ because of our assumptions. The solution is the savings function:\n$$s_{t} = s(w_{t}, R_{t+1}).$$\nThe solution is interior as a consequence of the assumptions, and it is characterised by the first-order condition:\n$$u^{\\prime}(w_{t} - s_{t}) = \\beta R_{t+1} u^{\\prime}(R_{t+1}s_{t}).$$\nLagrangian Instead, we can use the intertemporal budget constraint and build the Lagrangian:\n$$\\mathcal{L} = u(c_{t}) + \\beta u(d_{t+1}) + \\lambda_{t}(w_{t} - c_{t} - \\frac{d_{t+1}}{R_{t+1}}).$$\nThe first order conditions imply that:\n$$u^{\\prime}(c_{t}) = \\lambda_{t}, \\quad \\beta u^{\\prime}(d_{t+1}) = \\frac{\\lambda_{t}}{R_{t+1}}$$\nCombining both, we obtain the Euler equation:\n$$u^{\\prime}(c_{t}) = \\beta R_{t+1} u^\\prime (d_{t+1}).$$\n  There plenty of alternative notations for the OLG model. One may write $c^{y}_{t}$ and $c^{o}_{t}$ for young and adult consumption.

Before turning to it, we compute the intertemporal elasticity of substitution on this model, because it turns out to be a crucial element influencing savings. The intertemporal elasticity of substitution is a special case of the elasticity of substitution, that measures how the ratio of future to present consumption changes with the relative price (the interest rate).\nIntertemporal elasticity of substitution The intertemporal elasticity of substitution is defined as:\n$$\\epsilon_{d_{t+1}, c_{t}} = \\frac{ \\partial \\left( \\frac{d_{t+1}}{c_{t}} \\right)}{\\partial R_{t+1}} \\frac{ R_{t+1}}{\\left( \\frac{d_{t+1}}{c_{t}} \\right)}.$$\nFrom the Euler equation we have $\\frac{u^{\\prime}(c_{t})}{u^{\\prime}(d_{t+1})} = \\beta R_{t+1}.$ So, consumption when old $d_{t+1}$ is going to be proportional to consumption when young $c_{t}.$\nLet $d_{t+1} = x_{t+1} c_{t}.$ Then, the intertemporal elasticity of substitution becomes:\n$$\\epsilon_{d_{t+1}, c_{t}} = \\frac{ \\partial x_{t+1}}{\\partial R_{t+1}} \\frac{ R_{t+1}}{x_{t+1}}.$$\nWe can compute it using the Euler equation $u^\\prime(c_{t}) = \\beta R_{t+1} u^\\prime(x_{t+1}c_t).$ In fact, totally differentiating on both sides yields\n$$0 = - \\beta u^\\prime(x_{t+1}c_t)\\mathrm{d}R_{t+1} + \\beta R_{t+1}u^{\\prime \\prime}(x_{t+1}c_t) c_{t} \\mathrm{d}x_{t+1}.$$\nHence,\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x_{t+1}}{\\mathrm{d}R_{t+1}} = - \\frac{u^\\prime(x_{t+1}c_{t})}{R_{t+1}u^{\\prime \\prime}(x_{t+1}c_t)c_t} = - \\frac{u^\\prime (d_{t+1})}{R_{t+1}u^{\\prime \\prime}(d_{t+1})c_t}.$$\nThe intertemporal elasticity of substitution is then given by:\n$$\\epsilon_{d_{t+1}, c_{t}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}x_{t+1}}{\\mathrm{d}R_{t+1}}\\frac{R_{t+1}}{x_{t+1}} = - \\frac{u^\\prime (d_{t+1})}{R_{t+1}u^{\\prime \\prime}(d_{t+1})c_t}\\frac{R_{t+1}}{\\underbrace{x_{t+1}}_{\\frac{d_{t+1}}{c_{t}}}} = - \\frac{u^\\prime(d_{t+1})}{u^{\\prime \\prime}(d_{t+1}) d_{t+1}}.$$\nNote: the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is equal to the inverse of the coefficient of relative risk aversion. Risk averse individuals do not want large changes in consumption, so they have a large risk aversion and are not willing to trade off future and present consumption. Conversely, risk neutral individuals do not mind abrupt changes in consumption, so they are willing to trade off future and present consumption.\nHence, in this model, the intertemporal elasticity of substitution coincides with the inverse of the coefficient of relative risk aversion. Note: If you read p. 12 in de la Croix and Michel, they take a different approach and also refuse to use the concept or risk aversion: the model does not feature risk.\nCIES example We illustrate the previous concept using a constant intertemporal elasticity of substitution utility function:\n$$u( c ) = \\frac{c^{1-\\frac{1}{\\sigma}}}{1-\\frac{1}{\\sigma}}.$$\nIn this case, we have the following Euler condition:\n$$u^{\\prime}(c_{t}) = \\beta R_{t+1} u^{\\prime}(d_{t+1}) \\implies \\frac{d_{t+1}}{c_{t}} = \\left( \\beta R_{t+1} \\right)^\\sigma.$$\nTherefore, the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is\n$$\\epsilon_{d_{t+1}, c_{t}} = \\frac{ \\partial \\frac{d_{t+1}}{c_{t}} }{\\partial R_{t+1}} \\frac{R_{t+1}}{\\color{red}{\\frac{d_{t+1}}{c_{t}}}}= \\sigma (\\beta R_{t+1})^{\\sigma-1}\\beta R_{t+1} \\color{red}{\\frac{1}{(\\beta R_{t+1})^{\\sigma}}} = \\sigma. $$\nMeanwhile, the coefficient of relative risk aversion\n$$RRA( c ) = - \\frac{u^{\\prime \\prime}( c )}{u^{\\prime}( c )}c = \\frac{1}{\\sigma} = \\epsilon^{-1}_{d_{t+1},c_{t}}$$\nis the inverse of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution.\nThe savings function The savings function arises from solving:\n$$s(w, R) = \\arg \\max \\left[ u(w-s) + \\beta u(Rs) \\right].$$\nTaking the first derivative with respect to $s$ and solving provides an implicit function: the savings function.\n$$u^\\prime(w-s)(-1) + \\beta u^\\prime(Rs)R = 0.$$\nDenote this function $\\phi(s,w,R)$:\n$$\\phi(s, w, R ) = -u^\\prime(w-s)+ \\beta R u^\\prime(Rs) = 0.$$\nFollowing from the assumption on the utility function, the savings function is continuous and continuously differentiable.\nWe are interested in determining whether savings increase or decrease with wealth and the interest rate.\nThe effect of wages We begin by analysing the effect of wages on savings:\n$$\\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial w} = - \\frac{\\frac{\\partial \\phi(\\cdot)}{\\partial w}}{\\frac{\\partial \\phi(\\cdot)}{\\partial s}} = - \\frac{ - u^{\\prime \\prime}(w-s)}{u^{\\prime \\prime}(w-s)+\\beta R^{2} u^{\\prime \\prime}(Rs)} = \\frac{1}{\\underbrace{1+\\beta R^{2} \\underbrace{\\frac{u^{\\prime \\prime}(Rs)}{u^{\\prime \\prime}(w-s)}}_{\u0026gt;0}}_{\u0026gt;1}} \\in (0,1).$$\nWe thus have that the marginal propensity to save out of income is between 0 and 1: $0 \u0026lt; s^{\\prime}_{w} \u0026lt; 1,$ which reflects the fact that consumption goods are normal goods.\nThe effect of the interest rate Similarly, we compute the derivative of $\\frac{\\partial s(w,R)}{\\partial R}$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial R} = -\\frac{ \\beta u^{\\prime}(d) + \\beta R s u^{\\prime \\prime}(d)}{u^{\\prime \\prime}( c )+\\beta R^{2} u^{\\prime \\prime}(d)} =- \\frac{\\beta u^{\\prime}(d)\\left[1-\\frac{1}{\\sigma (d)} \\right]}{u^{\\prime \\prime}(c ) + \\beta R^{2} u^{\\prime \\prime}(d)}.$$\nHence, $$\\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial R} \\gtreqqless 0 \\quad \\mathrm{if} \\quad \\sigma (d) \\gtreqqless 1.$$\nTwo effects interact in this derivative:\n Wealth effect: if the interest rate rises, we obtain more out of the same savings, hence become wealthier. We consume more of all goods \u0026mdash;$c_{t}$ and $d_{t+1}$ are normal goods. Substitution effect: it is more profitable to save and consume $d_{t+1},$ inducing savings.  When the inter-temporal elasticity of substitution is lower than 1, the substitution effect is dominated by the income effect. In that case, a rise in the rate of return has a negative effect on savings. When the inter-temporal elasticity of substitution is higher than 1, households are ready to exploit the rise in the remuneration of savings by consuming relatively less today. In this case, raising the rate of return boosts savings. When the inter-temporal elasticity of substitution is equal to 1 (log-utility), the income effect exactly compensates the substitution effect and there is no effect of the rate of return on savings.\nExample using a CIES function Under a CIES utility, we have that:\n$$s(w,R) = \\frac{1}{1+\\beta^{-\\sigma}R^{1-\\sigma}}w,$$\nand $$s^{\\prime}_w =\\frac{1}{1+\\beta^{-\\sigma}R^{1-\\sigma}} \u0026gt; 0.$$\nHowever, $s^{\\prime}_{R} = - \\frac{w R^{-\\sigma}}{\\left(1+\\beta^{-\\sigma}R^{1-\\sigma}\\right)^{2}}(1-\\sigma)\\gtreqqless 0$ depending on $\\sigma \\lesseqqgtr 1.$\nLog-utility:\nIn the case of logarithmic utility, savings are independent of the interest rate $R$ and are linear in wages. Log-utility is a special case of the CIES function when $\\sigma=1.$ In this case, the wealth and substitution effects cancel each other:\n$$s(w,R) = \\frac{\\beta}{1+\\beta}w.$$\nExample using a CES function Note: This is a transformation of the CIES function, so things will look rather similar.\n$$U(c,d) = \\left[ \\alpha c^{\\frac{\\epsilon-1}{\\epsilon}} + (1-\\alpha)d^{\\epsilon-1}{\\epsilon} \\right]^{\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon-1}}.$$\nFrom here, substituting $c=w-s$ and $d=Rs$, and solving for the optimal savings we obtain:\n$$\\begin{eqnarray} \u0026amp; \\alpha (w-s)^{-\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}} = (1-\\alpha) R (Rs)^{-\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}} \\\\\\\n\u0026amp; s = \\frac{\\left[ \\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha} \\right]^{-\\epsilon} w}{R^{1-\\epsilon} + \\left[\\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha} \\right]^{-\\epsilon}} = \\frac{w}{1+\\left[ \\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha} \\right]^{\\epsilon} R^{1-\\epsilon}}. \\end{eqnarray} $$\nTherefore,\n$$s^{\\prime}_{R} = - \\frac{w}{\\left(1+\\left[ \\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha} \\right]^{\\epsilon} R^{1-\\epsilon}\\right)^{2}} \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha}\\right)^\\frac{\\epsilon}{1-\\epsilon}R^{-\\epsilon}.$$\nThen, when $\\epsilon \u0026gt;1$ savings increase with the interest rate: $s^{\\prime}_{R} \u0026lt; 0.$ In that case, the substitution effect dominates. Alternative interpretation: $\\epsilon$ is the elasticity of intertemporal substitutability, hence if it is large, individuals are willing to substitute present consumption for future consumption. Alternative interpretation: $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}$ measures the relative risk aversion. Hence, for large $\\epsilon$ individuals accept more risk, meaning that they are willing to accept more changes in consumption. Smoothing is less important.\nConversely, when $\\epsilon \u0026lt;1$, an increase in the interest rate lowers savings: $s^{\\prime}_{R} \u0026lt; 0.$ In that case, the wealth effect dominates. $\\epsilon \u0026lt; 1$ also means that $c$ and $d$ are intertemporally complementary, and individuals want to consume them in constant proportions.\n","date":1562803200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562803200,"objectID":"3b23dc76778f0a6244bf772ce5210426","permalink":"https://eric-roca.github.io/courses/olg/savings_function/","publishdate":"2019-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/olg/savings_function/","section":"courses","summary":"We now study how savings are affected by the remaining variables of the model.

It complements the Euler equation and allows to pinpoint the exact optimal path (see example below).\nWe use the transversality condition to avoid explosive consumption or saving paths that would end up in:\n Excessive consumption, driving the capital stock of the economy to zero and impeding future consumption, Excessive savings, up to the point that a large amount of the output is devoted to replace capital that depreciates.   Indeed, using only the Euler equation alongside with initial conditions allows for infinitely many optimal paths to be found. The Ramsey problem does not state any final value for capital $k_{t=T}$ (in fact, it does not even state a final period $T$ because $T \\rightarrow \\infty).$ Therefore, working only with the Euler equation and the initial stock of capital $k_{t=0} = k_{0}$ allows for infinitely optimal paths. In the following example, we try to solve the simple cake-eating problem without imposing the transversality condition, and obtain infinitely many solutions.\nExample: Cake-eating problem We try to maximise utility from eating a finite cake over an infinite amount of time. The size of the cake ($k$) is given: $k_{t=0} = k_0 \\ \u0026gt; 0.$ The problem reads:\n$$\\begin{eqnarray} \\max \u0026amp; \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\beta^{t} \\ln ( c_{t} ) \\\\\\\n\u0026amp; k_{t+1} = k_{t} - c_{t} \\\\\\\n\u0026amp; k_{t=0} = k_{0} \\end{eqnarray}$$\nWe solve it noting that we can decide on $c_{t}$ and $k_{t}.$ The Lagrangian is: $$\\mathcal{L} = \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\beta^{t} \\ln (c_{t}) + \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\lambda_{t} (k_{t+1} - k_{t} + c_{t}).$$ Taking derivatives with respect to $c_{t}$ and $k_{t}$, and noticing that $k_{t}$ appears together with the $\\lambda_{t-1}$ term gives us the Euler equation: $$c_{t+1} = \\beta c_{t}.$$ Hence, iterating, $c_{t} = \\beta^{t}c_{0}$ Plugging it in the constraint gives us: $k_{t+1} = k_{t} - \\beta^{t}c_{0}.$ Solving for $k_{t}$ gives us $k_{t} = D - \\frac{c_{0}(1-\\beta^{t})}{1-\\beta}.$ At this point, we can no longer proceed (we have the unknown $D$) unless we have the extra restriction given by the transversality condition. If we use it, which reads, $\\lim_{t \\rightarrow \\infty} \\beta^{t} u^{\\prime} (c_{t})k_{t+1}=0$ we can substitute $c_{t} = \\beta^{t} c_{0}$. Therefore: $\\lim_{t \\rightarrow \\infty} \\beta^{t} \\frac{1}{c_{t} k_{t+1}} = \\lim_{t \\rightarrow \\infty} \\beta^{t} \\frac{1}{\\beta^{t} c_{0}} k_{t+1} = \\lim_{t \\rightarrow \\infty} k_{t+1} = 0.$ So, at the limit, the size of the cake becomes zero, and we eat it completely. Note: This makes sense, because utility is increasing in consumption and leaving something behind would be a waste of resources.\nNow, with this additional information ($\\lim_{t \\rightarrow \\infty} k_{t+1} = 0$) we can close the problem using: $k_{t+1} = D - \\frac{c_{0}(1-\\beta^{t-1})}{1-\\beta}$. Hence $\\lim_{t \\rightarrow \\infty} k_{t+1} = \\lim_{t \\rightarrow \\infty} D - \\frac{c_{0}(1-\\beta^{t-1})}{1-\\beta} = D - \\frac{c_{0}}{1-\\beta} = 0.$ Therefore, $D = \\frac{c_{0}}{1-\\beta}$ which implies that $k_{t} = \\frac{c_{0}\\beta^{t}}{1-\\beta}$. Since $k_{t=0} = k_{0}$ we can easily obtain $c_{0}$ from: $k_{0} = \\frac{c_{0}}{1-\\beta} \\implies c_{0} = (1-\\beta)k_{0}.$\nFinally, we have that $c_{t} = \\beta^{t} c_{0} = \\beta^{t}(1-\\beta)k_{0}.$\nNote: This problem is more easily solved assuming since the beginning that the entire cake will be consumed. This is, $\\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} c_{t} = k_{0}$. In that case, the Lagrangian is: $\\mathcal{L} = \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\beta^{t} \\ln (c_{t}) + \\lambda (\\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} c_{t} - k_{0}).$ Notice that in this case we have only one $\\lambda$. It is simple to show that $c_{t} = \\beta c_{t-1}.$ Substituting this information in the constraint gives us $k_{0} = \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\beta^{t} c_{0} = \\frac{c_{0}}{1-\\beta}.$ Therefore, $c_{t} = \\beta^t (1-\\beta)k_{0}.$ There is one important remark regarding this alternative method. It indirectly uses the transversality condition. Remember that we obtained that $\\lim_{t \\rightarrow \\infty} k_{t+1} = 0$ which implies that the entire cake is consumed. In the alternative method we assumed it, which makes sense just by looking at the utility formulation.\nA wrong proof of the transversality condition In some cases the transversality constraint is justified as the limit when time goes to infinity of an equivalent problem with a finite horizon. This is, one can write an optimal program that ends at some specific period. For instance, our Ramsey problem with a terminal state can be written as: $$\\max_{c_{t}, k_{t+1}} \\sum_{t=0}^{T} \\beta^{t} u(c_{t}).$$\nWe impose that capital must be positive all periods: $k_{t+1} \\geq 0.$ Write the Lagrangian that corresponds to the Kuhn-Tucker problem:\n$$\\mathcal{L} = \\sum_{t=0}^{T} \\beta^{t} u(c_{t}) + \\sum_{t=0}^{T} \\lambda_{t}(w_{t} + r_{t} k_{t} + (1-\\delta)k_{t} - c_{t} - k_{t+1}) + \\sum_{t=0}^{T} \\mu_{t}k_{t+1}.$$\nTaking the appropriate derivatives with respect to $k_{t+1}, c_{t}$ and remembering the complementary slackness condition leaves us with the following system of equations, which we evaluate at $t=T.$ $$\\begin{eqnarray} \\beta^{T} u^{\\prime}(c_{T}) \u0026amp; = \\lambda_{T} \\\\\\\n\\lambda_{T} \u0026amp; = \\mu_{T} \\\\\\\n\\mu_{T} k_{T+1} \u0026amp; = 0. \\end{eqnarray}$$\nRearranging we can get: $$\\begin{equation} \\beta^{T} u^{\\prime} (c_{T}) k_{T+1} = 0. \\end{equation}$$\nThe equation above indicates that one of either two possibilities must be true:\n $\\beta^{T} u^{\\prime} (c_{T}) \u0026gt;0$ which requires $k_{T+1} = 0,$ $\\beta^{T} u^{\\prime} (c_{T}) = 0$ and $k_{T+1} \\geq 0.$  The first case indicates that we leave the world at time $T$ with zero capital. This makes sense because the optimisation does not go beyond $T$, and leaving resources unconsumed is not efficient: after all, we eat capital. So we eat everything before dying. The second case never arises: the marginal utility is zero only when consumption is infinite.\nLetting time go to infinity, the equation above becomes the transversality condition: $$\\lim_{t \\rightarrow \\infty} \\beta^{t}u^{\\prime}(c_{t})k_{t+1} = 0.$$\nThe transversality condition is a necessary condition: proof Proof by Kamihigashi (2002): A Simple Proof of the Necessity of the Transversality Condition\nKamihigashi (2002) shows that the transversality condition is a necessary condition in an optimal control problem. This proof neglects consumption and focuses on current and future values of $x_{t}.$ Consider the following maximisation problem:\n$$ \\max_{ \\{x_{t} \\}_{t=0}^{\\infty} } \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} v_{t}(x_{t}, x_{t+1}) \\\\\\\nx_{0} = \\bar{x_{0}}, \\forall t \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{+}, (x_{t}, x_{t+1}) \\in X_{t}. $$\nWe assume the following:\n $x_{t} \\in X \\subset \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{m}$, basically, $x_{t} \\geq 0,$ $X_{t}$ is convex, $(0,0) \\in X_{t},$ $U: Gr(\\Gamma) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is $\\mathcal{C}^{1}$ and concave, $\\forall (x,y) \\in Gr(\\Gamma), U_{y}(x,y) \\leq 0,$ For any feasible path ${x_{t}}, \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} v_{t}(x_{t}, x_{t+1}) \\equiv \\lim_{T \\rightarrow \\infty} \\sum_{t=0}^{T} v_{t}(x_{t}, x_{t+1})$ exists in $(-\\infty, \\infty).$  First, define an optimal path $\\{x_{t}^{\\star}\\}$ as a feasible path such that: $$\\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} v_{t}(x_{t}, x_{t+1}) \\leq \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} v_{t}(x_{t}^{\\star}, x_{t+1}^{\\star}).$$\nThe proof only involves using an argument derived from concavity. $$\\forall \\gamma \\in [0,1), \\forall \\lambda \\in [\\gamma, 1), \\frac{f(1)-f(\\lambda)}{1-\\lambda} \\leq \\frac{f(1)-f(\\gamma)}{1-\\gamma}.$$\nSuppose we deviate $\\lambda \\in [0,1)$ from the optimal path ${x_{t}^{\\star}}$ and follow a path that is feasible:\nLemma 1 $${x_{0}^{\\star}, x_{1}^{\\star}, \\ldots, x_{T}^{\\star}, \\lambda x_{T+1}^{\\star}, \\lambda x_{T+2}^{\\star}, \\ldots }.$$\nAgain, we are assuming that by taking $\\lambda \\in [0,1)$ this alternative path is feasible. By optimality we have: $$v_{T}(x_{T}^{\\star}, \\lambda x_{T+1}^{\\star}) - v_{T}(x_{T}^{\\star}, x_{T+1}^{\\star}) + \\sum_{t=T+1}^{\\infty}[v_{t}(\\lambda x_{t}^{\\star}, \\lambda x_{t+1}^{\\star}) - v_{t}(x_{t}^{\\star}, x_{t+1}^{\\star})] \\leq 0.$$ This condition essentially says that deviating from the optimal path reports less utility than following it.\nDivide through by $(1-\\lambda)$ and obtain:\n$$\\frac{v_{T}(x_{T}^{\\star}, \\lambda x_{T+1}^{\\star}) - v_{T}(x_{T}^{\\star}, x_{T+1}^{\\star})}{1-\\lambda} \\leq \\sum_{t=T+1}^{\\infty} \\frac{v_{t}(x_{t}^{\\star}, x_{t+1}^{\\star}) - v_{t}(\\lambda x_{t}^{\\star}, \\lambda x_{t+1}^{\\star})}{1-\\lambda} \\leq \\sum_{t=T+1}^{\\infty} [v_{t}(x_{t}^{\\star}, x_{t+1}^{\\star}) - v_{t}(0,0)].$$\nThe last inequality follows because of Lemma 1 and because $v$ is concave, setting $\\gamma = 0$.

We rely on the phase diagram for this analysis: it conveys the message quite efficiently. In what follows, we assume that the economy is at its steady-state level $(\\bar{k}^{\\mathcal{Gov}}, \\bar{c}^{\\mathcal{Gov}})$ when the government decides to change $G_t.$ Furthermore, we assume taxes are constant at some level $G_{t} = G_{1} \u0026gt; 0.$\nUnexpected, permanent rise in $G$ Suppose that the government announces a sudden and unexpected increase in $G: G_{2} \u0026gt; G_{1}.$ The Ramsey model illustrates the consequences of such a change.\nFirst, we assumed that the economy was at its steady state. The change in $G$, as we discussed before, moves the $k$-locus closer to the horizontal axis.\nWith the change in $G$, a new steady state emerges. The steady-state capital level $\\bar{k}^\\mathcal{Gov}(G_2) = \\bar{k}^\\mathcal{Gov}(G_{1})$ remains the same. However, households need to adjust their consumption level. Otherwise, they would not be on the saddle path, and they would follow a diverging trajectory leading to zero consumption. The unique possibility that puts the economy in the new steady state is for consumption to jump directly into it. This is, consumption must be reduced by the amount $\\Delta_{G} = G_{2} - G_{1}.$ Thus the size of the immediate fall in consumption is equal to the full amount of the increase in government purchases, and the capital stock and the real interest rate are unaffected.\nA similar policy under the Solow model would have implied a smaller reduction in consumption. In Solow, consumption is the fraction $1-s$ of current income. The tax decreases current income by $G$, but consumption would only change by $(1-s)G \u0026lt; G.$ Hence, the remaining part of the increase in $G$ is absorbed by a reduction in investments of the size $sG$: government purchases crowd out investment in the Solow model.\nUnexpected, temporary rise in $G$ Different from before, suppose that the increase in $G$ is only temporary, starting at $t=t_{0}$ and lasting until $t=t_{1}.$ We still suppose that the increase in taxes is unexpected. One possibility is to first jump to the new steady state, remain there while taxes are high, and at time $t=t_{1}$ jump back to the original steady state. However, this implies two discontinuities in consumption: the first and second jumps. This would imply that marginal utility falls discontinuously and this is not optimal.\nThere is a second possibility. First, decrease consumption by a smaller amount than before: $\\Delta_{c} \u0026lt; \\Delta_{G}.$ This implies that the economy is not in the new steady state $(\\bar{k}^\\mathcal{Gov}(G_2) , \\bar{c}^{\\mathcal{Gov}}(G_{2}))$, but above it. Thus, it is subject to the dynamics implied by the phase diagram: capital decreases and consumption increases. The initial jump in consumption must be carefully computed such that, at time $t=t_{1}$, the dynamics implied by $G_{2}$ put the economy on the saddle path of $G_{1}.$ This is, the economy undergoes a transition such that, at $t=t_{1}$ when taxes and dynamics \u0026mdash;and the phase diagram\u0026mdash; return to the original configuration, the economy is on its saddle path.\nThe figure above depicts in black the original $k$-locus \u0026mdash;for $G=G_{1}$\u0026mdash; and in red the temporary one while with $G=G_{2}.$ The economy first jumps from the initial steady state $(\\bar{k}^{\\mathcal{Gov}}(G_{1}), \\bar{c}^{\\mathcal{Gov}}(G_{1}))$ following the black arrow. From then onwards, the dynamics of the red $k$-locus determine the trajectory of the economy. In particular, it moves north-west following the orange curve. The initial jump is calculated in such a way that at $t=t_{1}$ the economy is on the saddle path corresponding to $G=G_{1}.$ From there, it simply follows the saddle path towards the steady state $(\\bar{k}^{\\mathcal{Gov}}(G_{1}), \\bar{c}^{\\mathcal{Gov}}(G_{1})).$\nDuring the transition, households reduce capital to sustain a higher and increasing level of consumption that would not be possible with $G_{2} \u0026gt; G_{1}.$ From $t=t_{1}$, consumption continues to grow, but capital starts accumulating again.\nThe change in consumption during $t=t_{0}$ is directly proportional to the length of the increase in taxes. The longer it is, the closer the economy jumps to the steady state $(\\bar{k}^{\\mathcal{Gov}}(G_{2}), \\bar{c}^{\\mathcal{Gov}}(G_{2})).$ However, it never reaches it: households always decrease their savings, which allows them to later be on the saddle path when taxes go back to $G_{1}.$\nAnticipated, permanent rise in $G$ Note: when analysing an anticipated measure, start from the end move backwards.\nSuppose that at time $t=t_{0}$ the government announces that at time $t=t_{1}$ taxes will permanently increase.\nOne possibility is to mimic the [unanticipated, permanent change](\u0026lt;{{ ref \u0026ldquo;#un_perm\u0026rdquo; \u0026gt;}}): remain at the original steady state $(\\bar{k}^\\mathcal{Gov}(G_{0}), \\bar{c}^\\mathcal{Gov}(G_{0}))$ until $t_{1}$, and then jump onto the new steady state. However, this represents a large cost in terms of utility: non-smooth changes penalise utility.\nInstead, households will slightly decrease consumption at $t_{0}$. The dynamics of the $(\\bar{k}^\\mathcal{Gov}(G_{0}), \\bar{c}^\\mathcal{Gov}(G_{0}))$ steady state will move the economy south-east: consumption decreases while capital increases. The first initial jump at $t_{0}$ must be such that, at $t_{1}$ the economy is on the saddle path corresponding to the new steady state $(\\bar{k}^\\mathcal{Gov}(G_{1}), \\bar{c}^\\mathcal{Gov}(G_{1})).$\nHence, during the transition, consumption continuously falls, but smoothly. Capital, instead, first accumulates and decreases from $t_{1}$ onwards.\nAnticipated, temporary rise in $G$ Note: when analysing an anticipated measure, start from the end move backwards.\nFinally, suppose that the increase in $G$ is temporary. At time $t=t_{0}$ the government announces that at time $t=t_{1}$ taxes will increase from $G_{0}$ to $G_{1}.$ The new tax regime will apply for some time, until $t=t_{2}$ when taxes will return to their original level $G_{0}.$\nIn that case households can decide to follow the same strategy as in an unanticipated, temporary increase. However, it entails a relatively large adjustment in terms of consumption at time $t=t_{1}$, when the new policy becomes effective. Instead, households can take advantage of the anticipation in the announcement: decrease the consumption at the announcement time $t=t_{0}$ by a relatively small amount. This places households on the black arrow trajectory, since the economy is still governed by the $(\\bar{k}^\\mathcal{Gov}(G_{0}), \\bar{c}^\\mathcal{Gov}(G_{0}))$-locus. In that case, though, the change in consumption is such that, when the new tax policy becomes effective, consumption follows the orange arrow. Finally, timing is again crucial because at time $t=t_{2}$ the economy must be on the saddle path that corresponds to the initial steady state: $(\\bar{k}^\\mathcal{Gov}(G_{0}), \\bar{c}^\\mathcal{Gov}(G_{0})).$\nIn that case, between $t_{0}$ and $t_{1}$, households decrease consumption and save. Between $t_{1}$ and $t_{2}$ first consumption continues to decrease and so does capital, but eventually consumption rises while capital continues to decrease. Finally, from $t_{2}$ onward, both capital and consumption rise along the saddle path. Note that, although consumption decreases, it does so continuously except for the initial jump. This consumption-smoothing decreases utility less than a discontinuous jumps.\n","date":1562803200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562803200,"objectID":"66b635229ab29bc9348145af52b7bc47","permalink":"https://eric-roca.github.io/courses/ramsey_gov/changing_g/","publishdate":"2019-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/ramsey_gov/changing_g/","section":"courses","summary":"We focus now on how a change in $G_{t}$ affects the behaviour of the economy.

Moreover, they do so inelastically. During period $t$ there are $N_{t}$ young agents and, hence, the supply of labour is $N_{t}$. Equating this to labour demand from firms $L_{t}$ gives the wage rate: $$w_{t} = \\omega\\left(\\frac{K_{t}}{N_{t}}\\right)=\\omega(k_{t}).$$\n  Capital market: Only old individuals own capital. Since firms operate competitively, they make zero profits. Hence, $f^{\\prime}(k_{t})K_{t}$ is distributed as interests. Old households receive $N_{t-1}R_{t}s_{t-1} = R_{t}K_{t}.$ So, what old households receive must equal what firms distribute In other terms: $R_{t}K_{t}= f^{\\prime}(k_{t}) K_{t}$ and $R_t = f^\\prime (k_t).$\n  Good market: Finding the equilibrium for this market departs from the otherwise similar Ramsey case. Remember that we have two types of agents: young and old. Total production is given by: $$Y_{t} = F(K_{t}, N_{t}) = \\color{red}{N_{t}} f(k_{t}).$$ Total demand for goods combines the consumption of $d_{t}$, the old generation living in period $t$, and the demand for consumption and investment from the young: $c_{t}, s_{t}.$ Therefore, counting how many old and young individuals live during period $t$ we have that total demand equals: $$N_{t-1}d_{t} + N_{t}(c_{t}+s_{t}).$$ The equilibrium on the goods market implies: $$Y_{t} = N_{t-1}d_{t} + N_{t}(c_{t}+s_{t}).$$\nAlso, we can check that total production equals total consumption: $$N_{t}(c_{t}+s_{t}) = N_{t}w_{t}=N_{t}(f(k_{t})-k_{t}f^{\\prime}(k_{t})) = Y_{t}-K_{t}f^{\\prime}(k_{t}),$$ $$N_{t-1}d_{t} = N_{t-1}R_{t}s_{t-1} = R_{t}K_{t} = K_{t}f^{\\prime}(k_{t}).$$\n  A temporary equilibrium is a set $\\{w_{t}, R_{t}, K_{t}, L_{t}, Y_{t}, k_{t}, I_{t}, c_{t}, s_{t}, d_{t}\\}$ that satisfies:\n$$\\begin{eqnarray} w_{t} = \\omega(k_{t}), \\\\\\\nR_{t} = f^{\\prime}(k_{t}), \\\\\\\nL_{t} = N_{t}, \\\\\\\nY_{t} = N_{t}f(k_{t}), \\\\\\\nY_{t} = N_{t-1}d_t + N_{t}(c_{t}+s_{t}) \\\\\\\nI_{t} = N_{t}s_{t}, \\\\\\\nc_{t} = w_{t} - s_{t}, \\\\\\\ns_{t} = s(\\omega(k_{t}),R_{t+1}), \\\\\\\nd_{t} = R_{t}s_{t-1}. \\end{eqnarray}$$\nThe existence of a temporary equilibrium is guaranteed because the functions are single-valued.\nIntertemporal equilibrium with perfect foresight The equilibrium equation that links two consecutive periods is the capital accumulation equation. In particular, the savings of young individuals at period $t$ are transformed into productive capital at $t+1.$\nNote: in this model, it is useful to write the equations first in aggregate terms and then convert them to its intensive-form representation.\n$$K_{t+1} = N_{t}s_{t} = N_{t} s\\left( \\omega(k_{t}), R_{t+1} \\right).$$\nIn intensive form:\n$$k_{t+1} = \\frac{K_{t+1}}{\\color{red}{N_{t+1}}} = \\frac{N_{t}}{\\color{red}{N_{t+1}}} s\\left( \\omega(k_{t}), R_{t+1} \\right) = \\frac{1}{1+n}s\\left( \\omega(k_{t}), R_{t+1} \\right) .$$\nFinally, we can incorporate the equilibrium in the capital market (together with perfect foresight) and replace $R_{t+1} = f^{\\prime}(k_{t+1}):$\n$$k_{t+1} =\\frac{1}{1+n}s \\left( \\omega(k_{t}), f^{\\prime}(k_{t+1}) \\right).$$\nIntertemporal equilibrium (for perfect foresigt): Given an initial capital stock $k_{0} = K_{0} \\big{/} N_{-1}$, an intertemporal equilibrium (for perfect foresight) is a sequence of temporary equilibria that satisfies for all $t\u0026gt;0$ the equation:\n$$k_{t+1} =\\frac{1}{1+n}s \\left( \\omega(k_{t}), f^{\\prime}(k_{t+1}) \\right).$$\nNote: de la Croix and Michel discuss on pp. 20\u0026ndash;27 the existence and uniqueness of the intertemporal equilibrium.\nExistence of an intertemporal equilibrium The existence of at least one temporary equilibrium is guaranteed by the properties of the functions. The proof is quite involved, though, as is presented below. Having an intertemporal equilibrium means having a solution for $k_{t+1}$ in the equation\n$$k_{t+1} = \\frac{1}{1+n}s(\\omega(k_t), f^\\prime (k_{t+1})),$$\nwhere $k_t$ is predetermined at $t.$\n Proof The proof uses the following equation about savings: $$0\u0026lt; s\\left( w, f^\\prime(k) \\right) \u0026lt; w.$$$ In words, it indicates that individuals have positive savings, and they save only part of their total income.\nNext, define $$H(k,w) = (1+n)k - s(w, f^\\prime(k))= 0.$$ Basically, here we are using the definition of an intertemporal equilibrium. Having an intertemporal equilibrium is then equivalent to finding a $k$ satisfying the previous equation.\nWe use the intermediate value theorem to show that at least one solution exists. First, we analyse the behaviour of $H(k,w)$ when $k$ tends to $+\\infty.$\nFrom $0\u0026lt; s\\left( w, f^\\prime(k) \\right) \u0026lt; w,$ we have\n$$0 \u0026lt; \\frac{s(w, f^\\prime (k))}{k} \u0026lt; \\frac{w}{k}.$$\nLimit when $k \\rightarrow +\\infty$\nKeeping $w$ fixed, the limit of $\\frac{w}{k}$ when $k \\rightarrow +\\infty$ is 0. Then,\n$$\\lim_{k \\rightarrow +\\infty} \\frac{s(w, f^\\prime (k))}{k} = 0.$$\nConsequently,\n$$\\lim_{k \\rightarrow +\\infty}\\frac{H(w,k)}{k} = \\lim_{k \\rightarrow +\\infty} (1+n) - \\frac{s(w, f^\\prime (k))}{k} = 1+n \u0026gt; 0.$$\nLimit when $k \\rightarrow 0$\nWhen $k$ tends to zero, we shall distinguish two cases regarding $f^\\prime (k)$. It can be that either\n  Case $\\lim_{k \\rightarrow 0} f^\\prime (k) = f^\\prime (0)\u0026gt; 0$ and finite. Then, the function $s(w, f^\\prime(k))$ is well defined and positive and we have:\n$$\\lim_{k \\rightarrow 0} H(w,k) = \\lim_{k \\rightarrow 0} \\left[(1+n)k - s(w,f^\\prime (k)) \\right] = -s(w, f^\\prime (k)) \u0026lt; 0.$$\n  Case $\\lim_{k \\rightarrow 0} f^\\prime (k) = +\\infty.$ Two things can occur in that case.\n Savings are positive: $\\lim_{k \\rightarrow 0} s(w,f^\\prime (k))\u0026gt;0.$ This case is analogous to the previous one:  $$\\lim_{k \\rightarrow 0} H(w,k) = \\lim_{k \\rightarrow 0} \\left[(1+n)k - s(w,f^\\prime (k)) \\right] = -s(w, f^\\prime (k)) \u0026lt; 0.$$\n  Savings tend to zero: $\\lim_{k \\rightarrow 0} s(w, f^\\prime (k)) = 0.$ In this case, since the interest rate goes to infinity individuals tend to save zero. This implies that consumption in the second period, $d$, tends to infinity. To see this, first notice that $d = f^\\prime (k) s(w, f^\\prime (k)).$ Moreover, from the first order conditions we know that: $$u^\\prime (d) = \\frac {u^\\prime ( w - s)}{\\beta f^\\prime (k)}$$ and hence $$\\lim_{k \\rightarrow 0}u^\\prime (d) = \\lim_{k \\rightarrow 0}\\frac {u^\\prime ( w - s)}{\\beta f^\\prime (k)}=0.$$ Hence, $u^\\prime (d)$ tends to zero which means that $d$ goes to infinity. Therefore: $$\\lim_{k \\rightarrow 0} f^\\prime (k) s(w, f^\\prime (k)) = +\\infty.$$\nWe also know that $0 \u0026lt; f^\\prime (k) k \u0026lt; f(k)$ because $f^\\prime (k) k + \\omega(k) = f(k)$ and $\\omega(k) \u0026gt; 0.$ Therefore, for a bounded $0\u0026lt;k\u0026lt;1$ we also have $f^\\prime (k) k \u0026lt; f(1). Hence, for $k\u0026lt;1$:\n$$\\frac{s(w, f^\\prime (k))}{k} = \\frac{f^\\prime(k) s(w,f^\\prime(k))}{f^\\prime (k) k} \u0026gt; \\frac{f^\\prime (k) s(w, f^\\prime (k))}{f(1)}.$$ Then,\n$$\\lim_{k \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{s(w,f^\\prime(k)}{k} = +\\infty$$ and $$\\frac{H(w,k)}{k} = 1+n-\\frac{s(w,f^\\prime(k)}{k} \u0026lt; 0$$ for small $k$.\n     Uniqueness of the intertemporal equilibrium Having established that at least one level $k_{t+1}$ exists that solves the equation, we would like it to be unique, thus having a unique equilibrium. Otherwise, for some level $k$ there would be multiple values for $k_{t+1}$ (meaning multiple values for the savings). Individuals lack a coordinating mechanism to select any of these equilibria.\nWe show that the intertemporal elasticity of substitution $\\sigma$ is important in determining uniqueness. In particular, if $\\sigma \u0026gt; 1$, then the equilibrium is unique. We will revisit this issue later.\n We have used the intermediate value theorem to show that solutions exist. Moreover, it shows that $\\lim_{k\\rightarrow 0} \\frac{H(w,k)}{k} \u0026lt; 0$ and $\\lim_{k \\rightarrow +\\infty} \\frac{H(w,k)}{k} \u0026gt; 0.$ Therefore, if $H(w,k)$ is monotonically increasing in $k$, then there is one and only one solution to $H(w,k)=0.$ Hence, we would have a unique solution. This means that given a value $k_{t},$ we can find a unique valu $k_{t+1}.$\nIf we take the derivative of $H(w,k)$ with respect to $k$, we obtain:\n$$1+n - s^{\\prime}_R f^{\\prime \\prime}(k).$$\nConsequently, in order to have a monotonous function it is sufficient to impose:\nAssumption OLG.4 : $$1+n - s^{\\prime}_R f^{\\prime \\prime}(k) \u0026gt; 0.$$\nAnd then, $k_{t+1} = g(k_{t}).$\nIn particular, this condition indicates that the effect of the interest rate on savings should not be too negative.\nMoreover, if OLG.4 is verified, then $k_{t+1}$ is increasing in $k_{t}.$ Indeed,\n$$k_{t+1} = g(k_t, k_{t+1}) = \\frac{1}{1+n} s(\\omega(k_t), R(k_{t+1})).$$\nand\n$$\\frac{\\partial k_{t+1}}{\\partial k_t} = - \\frac{\\frac{\\partial g(k_{t}, k_{t+1})}{\\partial k_t}}{\\frac{\\partial g(k_t, k_{t+1})}{\\partial k_{t+1}}} = \\frac{\\overbrace{s^\\prime_{\\omega} \\omega^\\prime(k_t)}^{\u0026gt;0}}{1+n-s^\\prime_{R} \\underbrace{R^\\prime(k_{t+1})}_{=f^{\\prime \\prime} (k_{t+1}) \u0026lt; 0}} \u0026gt; 0,$$\nand $k_{t+1}$ increases in $k_{t}.$\nFinally, we can use a more restrictive \u0026mdash;but easier to work with\u0026mdash; assumption that ensures a unique solution for the intertemporal equilibrium. Assumption OLG.4 states:\n$$1+n - s^{\\prime}_R f^{\\prime \\prime}(k) \u0026gt; 0.$$\nTherefore, it is sufficient to have\n$$s^{\\prime}_R \\geq 0$$\nmeaning that savings increase with the interest rate. This behaviour is readily verified when the intertemporal elasticity of substitution of at least one. Then, to have monotonic dynamics and unique temporal equilibrium it is sufficient to have $\\sigma \\geq 1.$\n","date":1562803200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562803200,"objectID":"8150bebb02cee232cb2655c2d678661d","permalink":"https://eric-roca.github.io/courses/olg/equilibrium/","publishdate":"2019-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/olg/equilibrium/","section":"courses","summary":"Temporary equilibrium Before turning to the intertemporal equilibrium and the analysis of the steady state, we study the temporary equilibrium that takes place every period.\nWe have not discussed the firms, but they follow the same setup as in Ramsey: use capital and labour in a perfectly competitive environment.","tags":null,"title":"Intertemporal equilibrium","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Steady states A steady state of an N-dimensional dynamic system is a configuration of the system variables such that the system remains unchanged over time.

Moreover, the steady state is often approached asymptotically: it is never fully reached, but we get infinitesimally close to it. Finally, steady states can be (asymptotically) stable or unstable. In the first sort, variables approach the steady-state level. In the second, the system diverges from the steady state.\n The steady state in the Ramsey model In our case, denote by $(\\bar{k}, \\bar{c}) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{2}$ the capital and consumption levels at the steady state. Then, a steady-state solution satisfies the following system of equations:\n$$\\left. \\begin{eqnarray} u^{\\prime}(\\bar{c}) \u0026amp; = \\beta (f^{\\prime}(\\bar{k}) + 1 -\\delta) u^{\\prime}(\\bar{c}), \\\\\\\n\\bar{k} \u0026amp; = f(\\bar{k}) + (1-\\delta) \\bar{k} - \\bar{c}. \\end{eqnarray} \\right\\} \\tag{9, Steady St.} \\label{eq:ss}$$\nSimplifying we can obtain the following, equivalent expression:\n$$\\left. \\begin{eqnarray} f^{\\prime}(\\bar{k}) = \\frac{\\theta}{\\beta}, \\\\\\\n\\bar{c} = f(\\bar{k}) - \\delta \\bar{k}, \\end{eqnarray} \\right\\} \\tag{9.1, Steady St.} \\label{eq:ss2}$$\nwhere $\\theta \\equiv 1 - \\beta(1-\\delta) \\in (0,1).$\nExistence of the steady state From the Inada conditions for the production (Assumption R3.6) function we have that\n$$0 = \\lim_{k \\rightarrow +\\infty} f^{\\prime}(k) \u0026lt; \\frac{\\theta}{\\beta} \u0026lt; \\lim_{k \\rightarrow 0}f^{\\prime}(k) = +\\infty.$$\nHence, $f^\\prime (k)$ takes values on the interval $(0, +\\infty).$ Since the function $f^\\prime$ is continuous, by the intermediate value theorem there exists at least one $k=\\bar{k}$ such that $f^\\prime{\\bar{k}} = \\frac{\\theta}{\\beta}.$\nMoreover, from Assumption R3.4 the function $f^\\prime (k)$ is monotonically decreasing. Therefore, there exists one and only one value $\\bar{k} \\in (0,+\\infty)$ that solves the first equation in \\ref{eq:ss2}. Also, the second equation in \\ref{eq:ss2} uniquely determines the level of consumption given capital. Hence, the steady-state consumption level $\\bar{c}$ is unique.\nWe can obtain an overview of the dynamics of the model using the phase diagram and derive the exact solution using the method outlined in trajectory.\nStability of the steady state We are now interested in determining the behaviour of the economy when it starts with some level of capital $k_0$ and consumption $c_0.$ The economy is represented by a $2 \\times 2$ system of first-order difference equations. The stability of a steady state depends on the Jacobian matrix\u0026rsquo;s eigenvalues evaluated at the steady state. Note: the Appendix discusses this in more detail. In particular, we wonder whether the dynamics are such that they converge towards the steady state or diverge away from it.\nThe equations that govern the economy are the Euler equation and the law for capital accumulation:\n$$\\left. \\begin{eqnarray} u^{\\prime}(c_{t}) = \\beta (f^{\\prime}(k_{t+1}) + 1 - \\delta) u^{\\prime}(c_{t+1}), \\\\\\\nk_{t+1} = f(k_{t}) + (1-\\delta) k_{t} - c_{t} \\end{eqnarray} \\right\\}. \\tag{8.1 Equilibrium} $$\nThe stability of the steady state first requires computing the Jacobian matrix. The Jacobian matrix associated to the system is:\n$$\\bar{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial c_{t+1}}{\\partial c_{t}} \u0026amp; \\frac{\\partial c_{t+1}}{\\partial k_{t}} \\\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial k_{t+1}}{\\partial c_{t}} \u0026amp; \\frac{\\partial k_{t+1}}{\\partial k_{t}} \\end{pmatrix}.$$\nNotice that $\\bar{A}$ represents the approximate linear behaviour of the economy at any given point: $\\begin{pmatrix}c_{t+1} \\\\\\ k_{t+1}\\end{pmatrix} \\approx \\begin{pmatrix} c_0 \\\\\\ k_0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\bar{A} \\begin{pmatrix} c_t - c_0 \\\\\\ k_t - k_0 \\end{pmatrix}.$\nIn our case, the Jacobian matrix reads:\n$$\\bar{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{u^{\\prime \\prime}(c_{t})+\\beta f^{\\prime \\prime}(k_{t+1})u^{\\prime}(c_{t+1})}{\\beta \\left[ f^{\\prime}(k_{t+1}) + 1 - \\delta \\right] u^{\\prime \\prime}(c_{t+1})} \u0026amp; -\\frac{\\beta f^{\\prime \\prime}(k_{t+1}) \\left[ f^{\\prime}(k_{t}) + 1 - \\delta \\right] u^{\\prime}(c_{t+1})}{\\beta \\left[ f^{\\prime}(k_{t+1}) + 1 - \\delta \\right] u^{\\prime \\prime}(c_{t+1})} \\\\\\\n-1 \u0026amp; f^{\\prime}(k_{t}) + 1 - \\delta \\end{pmatrix}. \\tag{10, Jacobian} \\label{eq:jacobian}$$\nThen, we evaluate \\ref{eq:jacobian} at the steady state.

As mentioned before, the stability of a steady state depends on the eigenvalues of $\\bar{A}$ (eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic equation). Typically, we are only interested in some properties of the eigenvalues.\nBlanchard-Kahn characterises the types of steady states in terms of their eigenvalues. Denote by $l$ the number of eigenvalues in the unit circle, and denote by $m$ the number of pre-determined state variables:\n if $l=m$ (standard case): saddle-path, unique optimal trajectory. The eigenvalues within the unit circle govern the speed of convergence. if $l \\lt m$: unstable if $l \\gt m$: multiple optimal trajectories.  We can use different techniques to determine whether the eigenvalues lay in the interval $(-1,1).$\nDirect computation of the eigenvalues The first method we present uses the definition of eigenvalue: the roots of the characteristic equation. It requires solving:\n$$\\begin{vmatrix} 1-\\beta f^{\\prime \\prime}(\\bar{k})\\frac{\\bar{c}}{\\epsilon_{\\bar{c}}} - \\lambda \u0026amp; f^{\\prime \\prime}(\\bar{k}) \\frac{\\bar{c}}{\\epsilon_{\\bar{c}}} \\\\\\\n-1 \u0026amp; \\frac{1}{\\beta} - \\lambda \\end{vmatrix} = \\lambda^{2} + \\lambda \\left( \\beta f^{\\prime \\prime} (\\bar{k}) \\frac{\\bar{c}}{\\epsilon_{\\bar{c}}} - 1 - \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\right) + \\frac{1}{\\beta} = 0.$$\nThe roots of this equation are:\n$$\\lambda_{1} = \\frac{\\overbrace{1+\\overbrace{\\frac{1}{\\beta}}^{\u0026gt;1} - \\overbrace{\\beta f^{\\prime \\prime}(\\bar{k}) \\frac{\\bar{c}}{\\epsilon_{\\bar{c}}}}^{\u0026lt;0} + \\sqrt{\\left( 1+\\frac{1}{\\beta} - \\beta f^{\\prime \\prime}(\\bar{k})\\frac{\\bar{c}}{\\epsilon_{\\bar{c}}} \\right)^2 - \\frac{4}{\\beta}}}^{\u0026gt;2}}{2} \u0026gt; 1 .$$\nFor $\\lambda_{2}$ we have:\n$$\\lambda_{2} = \\frac{1+\\frac{1}{\\beta} - \\beta f^{\\prime \\prime}(\\bar{k}) \\frac{\\bar{c}}{\\epsilon_{\\bar{c}}} - \\sqrt{\\left( 1+\\frac{1}{\\beta} - \\beta f^{\\prime \\prime}(\\bar{k})\\frac{\\bar{c}}{\\epsilon_{\\bar{c}}} \\right)^2 - \\frac{4}{\\beta}}}{2} \u0026gt; 0$$\nTo simplify notation, let $\\phi \\equiv 1+\\frac{1}{\\beta} - \\beta f^{\\prime \\prime}(\\bar{k}) \\frac{\\bar{c}}{\\epsilon_{\\bar{c}}}$ and $\\kappa \\equiv \\frac{4}{\\beta}$. Assume that $\\lambda_{2} \u0026gt; 1$, then we must have:\n$$\\frac{\\phi - \\sqrt{\\phi^{2} - \\kappa}}{2} \u0026gt; 1 \\implies \\kappa \u0026gt; 4\\phi - 4.$$ Substituting: $$4 + \\frac{4}{\\beta} - 4 \\beta f^{\\prime \\prime}(\\bar{k})\\frac{\\bar{c}}{\\epsilon_{\\bar{c}}} - 4 \u0026lt; \\frac{4}{\\beta} \\implies -4\\beta f^{\\prime \\prime}(\\bar{k})\\frac{\\bar{c}}{\\epsilon_{\\bar{c}}} \u0026lt; 0.$$ But this is impossible because $f^{\\prime \\prime}(\\cdot) \u0026lt; 0.$ Hence, $\\lambda_{2} \u0026lt; 1$.\nSummarising, the eigenvalues are such that $$\\lambda_{1} \u0026gt; 1$$\nand $$\\lambda_{2}\\in(0,1)$$\nand the steady state is a saddle.\nUse the intermediate value theorem The characteristic equation associated with the Jacobian evaluated at the steady state is:\n$$G(\\lambda) = \\lambda^{2} + \\lambda \\left( \\beta f^{\\prime \\prime} (\\bar{k}) \\frac{\\bar{c}}{\\epsilon_{\\bar{c}}} - 1 - \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\right) + \\frac{1}{\\beta} = 0.$$\nFirst, notice that $G(\\lambda)$ is a continuous function on $\\lambda.$ We want to assess whether its roots (or at least one root) lay in the interval $(-1,1)$. The behaviour of $G(\\lambda)$ is as follows:\n$$\\lim_{\\lambda \\rightarrow -\\infty} G(\\lambda) = + \\infty$$ $$\\lim_{\\lambda \\rightarrow +\\infty} G(\\lambda) = + \\infty$$ $$G(-1) = 2 + \\frac{2}{\\beta} - \\beta f^{\\prime \\prime}(\\bar{k})\\frac{\\bar{c}}{\\epsilon_{\\bar{c}}} \u0026gt; 0$$ $$G(0) = \\frac{1}{\\beta} \u0026gt; 0 $$ $$G(1) = \\beta f^{\\prime \\prime}(\\bar{k})\\frac{\\bar{c}}{\\epsilon_{\\bar{c}}} \u0026lt; 0.$$\nHence, $\\exists \\lambda_{2} \\in (-1,0)$ such that $G(\\lambda_{2}) = 0$. The second root lies beyond $1.$ Therefore, $\\lambda_{1} \u0026gt; 1, \\lambda_{2}\\in(0,1)$ and the steady state is a saddle.\nUse eigenvalues\u0026rsquo; properties For any matrix, we have the following:\n The product of eigenvalues equals the determinant of the matrix: $\\mathrm{det}(M) = \\lambda_{1} \\lambda_{2} \\ldots \\lambda_{N},$ The sum of eigenvalues equals the trace of matrix: $\\mathrm{tr}(M) = \\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2} + \\ldots + \\lambda_{N}.$  In our case:\n$$\\lambda_{1} \\lambda_{2} = \\frac{1}{\\beta} $$ $$\\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2} = \\underbrace{1+ \\frac{1}{\\beta} - \\beta f^{\\prime \\prime}(\\bar{k})\\frac{\\bar{c}}{\\epsilon_{\\bar{c}}}}_{\u0026gt;1}.$$\nThe first equation implies that either\n a) $\\lambda_{1} \u0026gt; 0, \\lambda_{2} \u0026gt; 0$ or b) $\\lambda_{1} \u0026lt; 0, \\lambda_{2} \u0026lt; 0.$  However, since $\\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2} \u0026gt; 1$ b) is impossible. Therefore, $\\lambda_{1} \u0026gt; 0, \\lambda_{2} \u0026gt; 0.$\nSubstitute $\\lambda_{1} \\lambda_{2} = \\frac{1}{\\beta}$ in the second equation:\n$$ \\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2} = 1+ \\lambda_{1} \\lambda_{2} - \\beta f^{\\prime \\prime}(\\bar{k})\\frac{\\bar{c}}{\\epsilon_{\\bar{c}}}.$$\nRearranging: $$ \\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2} - \\lambda_{1} \\lambda_{2} = 1+ - \\beta f^{\\prime \\prime}(\\bar{k})\\frac{\\bar{c}}{\\epsilon_{\\bar{c}}} \u0026gt; 1 \\implies \\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2} - \\lambda_{1}\\lambda_{2} - 1 \u0026gt;0.$$ Factorisation leads to: $$(1 - \\lambda_{2})(\\lambda_{1} - 1) \u0026gt; 0.$$ Therefore, because $\\lambda_{1},, \\lambda_{2} \u0026gt; 0$ we must have\n$$ \\lambda_{2} \u0026lt; 1 $$ $$ \\lambda_{1} \u0026gt; 1 $$ $$ \\lambda_{1} \u0026gt; 0, \\lambda_{2} \u0026gt; 0$$ and the steady state is a saddle.\n","date":1562803200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562803200,"objectID":"adb82f8797a61cd520b4303e9e7f2b41","permalink":"https://eric-roca.github.io/courses/ramsey/steady_state_ramsey/","publishdate":"2019-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/ramsey/steady_state_ramsey/","section":"courses","summary":"Steady states A steady state of an N-dimensional dynamic system is a configuration of the system variables such that the system remains unchanged over time.

In that case, since $\\omega(0)=0$ and we know that individuals save a fraction of their income:\n$$s(\\omega(0), R(0)) \u0026lt; \\omega(0) = 0.$$\nHence, given zero capital, savings are equally zero and capital remains there, constituting a steady state.\nAlternatively, if it is possible to produce without capital (CES production function with large enough substitutability), the autarkic steady state does not exist.\nExample of the autarkic steady state Take $F(K,L)=(\\alpha K^{\\rho} + (1-\\alpha)L^{\\rho})^{\\frac{1}{\\rho}}$ and $u( c ) = \\log( c ).$ Furthermore, assume a low elasticity of substitution, $\\rho \u0026laquo; 0.$ In intensive form, production equals:\n$$f(k_{t}) = (\\alpha k_{t}^{\\rho} + (1-\\alpha))^{\\frac{1}{\\rho}}.$$ Wages and savings are:\n$$\\omega(k_{t}) = (1-\\alpha)(\\alpha k^\\rho + (1-\\alpha))^{\\frac{1}{\\rho}-1}$$ $$s_{t} = \\frac{\\beta}{1+\\beta}w_{t}.$$\nThen, capital accumulation becomes:\n$$k_{t+1} = \\frac{1}{1+n}\\frac{\\beta}{1+\\beta}(1-\\alpha)\\left[\\alpha k_{t}^\\rho + 1 - \\alpha \\right]^\\frac{1-\\rho}{\\rho}.$$\nWith low substitutability, $\\rho \u0026lt; 0$, zero is always a possible steady state. There can be two additional, positive steady states depending on the curvature of $k_{t+1}.$\nSimilarly, the Cobb-Douglas case $\\rho \\rightarrow 0$ also has zero as a steady state. However, it is unstable.\nOther steady state The economy can also present interior steady states with $\\bar{k}\u0026gt;0.$ Unlike the Ramsey model, here we can have stable and unstable steady states, as we shall see. Moreover, the configuration varies depending on the production and utility functions.\nStability of the steady state This model can feature one or several steady states. This depends on the characteristics of the production and utility functions.\nFirst, the dynamics of $k$ are monotonic: either continuously increase or decrease. This follows from assuming a unique intertemporal equilibrium, see also. This extra assumption also implies that the intermporal elasticity of substitution is not too small. In particular, we operationalise (p. 25 in de la Croix and Michel.) it as:\n$$\\forall c\u0026gt;0, \\quad u^\\prime( c ) + c u^{\\prime \\prime}( c ) \\geq 0 \\Leftrightarrow \\sigma( c ) \\geq 1.$$\nDue to the fact the monotonicity of the dynamics, capital can converge either to $0,, \\bar{k}\\in (0,+\\infty),, $ or $+\\infty.$\nThe economy never goes to $k = +\\infty$ This is equivalent to saying that starting with a a high level of capital $k_{0}$, the dynamics imply $k_{t+1} \u0026lt; k_{t}.$\nFirst, we have that:\n$$g(k) = \\frac{1}{1+n}s(\\omega(k),f^\\prime(\\underbrace{g(k)}_{k_{t+1}}))\u0026lt;\\frac{\\omega(k)}{1+n}.$$ This holds because savings $s$ are always a fraction of wages $\\omega.$\nSecond, we show that:\n$$\\lim_{k \\rightarrow +\\infty}\\frac{g(k)}{k} = 0.$$\nTo see the intuition for this limit, assume for a moment it holds. Then, it must be that for large enough $k,, g(k) = k_{t+1} \u0026lt; k_{t}$ and the dynamics are decreasing and converge to some $\\bar{k}.$ In this case, $\\bar{k}$ is the largest steady state, and because the dynamics are monotonic, the economy never goes to the other side of the steady state.\nWe show next that $\\lim_{k \\rightarrow +\\infty}\\frac{g(k)}{k} = 0.$ We do so by showing that $\\lim_{k \\rightarrow +\\infty} \\color{green}{\\frac{\\omega(k)}{k}} = 0.$\n Detailed explanation We start by noting that: $$\\color{green}{\\frac{\\omega(k)}{k}} = \\color{red}{\\frac{f(k)}{k}} - \\color{blue}{f^\\prime (k)} \\leftarrow \\omega(k) = f(k) - f^\\prime (k) k.$$\nWhen $k \\rightarrow +\\infty$, the first term $\\color{red}{\\frac{f(k)}{k}}$ admits a positive limit, let\u0026rsquo;s call it $\\mathcal{l}_{1}.$ This is because:\n $\\color{red}{\\frac{f(k)}{k}} \u0026gt; 0.$ $\\color{red}{\\frac{f(k)}{k}}$ is decreasing: $$\\frac{\\partial \\color{red}{\\frac{f(k)}{k}}}{\\partial k} = \\frac{f^\\prime(k)k-f(k)}{k^{2}} = - \\frac{f(k) - f^\\prime (k) k}{k^{2}} = - \\frac{\\omega(k)}{k^{2}} \u0026lt; 0.$$  The second term $\\color{blue}{f^\\prime (k)}$ is decreasing and positive, thus it admits a limit $\\mathcal{l}_{2}$ when $k \\rightarrow +\\infty.$\nApply the mean value theorem evaluated at $k$ and $2k$:1\n$$f(2k) - f(k) = (2k-k)f^\\prime(k(1+\\theta)), \\quad \\mathrm{with}, \\theta \\in (0,1).$$ Then, $$\\frac{2f(2k)}{2k} - \\frac{f(k)}{k} = f^\\prime(k(1+\\theta))$$ Taking the limit when $k \\rightarrow +\\infty$ we obtain $2\\mathcal{l}_{1}-\\mathcal{l}_{1} = \\mathcal{l}_{2} \\implies \\mathcal{l}_{1} = \\mathcal{l}_{2}.$\nFinally,\n$$\\lim_{k \\rightarrow + \\infty}\\color{green}{\\frac{\\omega(k)}{k}} =\\lim_{k \\rightarrow +\\infty}\\color{red}{\\frac{f(k)}{k}} - \\color{blue}{f^\\prime (k)}= \\mathcal{l}_{1} - \\mathcal{l}_{2} = 0.$$\n Since $\\lim_{k \\rightarrow +\\infty} \\color{green}{\\frac{\\omega(k)}{k}}=0$ and $\\frac{g(k)}{k} \u0026lt; \\color{green}{\\frac{\\omega(k)}{k}}$ then $\\lim_{k \\rightarrow +\\infty}\\frac{g(k)}{k} = 0.$ In conclusion, if the inital value of capital is large enough, the dynamics are decreasing and $k$ converges to an interior steady state $\\bar{k}.$\nExamples Example 1: Log-utility and Cobb-Douglas Suppose that $u(c,d) = \\log ( c ) + \\beta \\log(d)$ and $f(k_t) = Ak_t^\\alpha.$\nThe wage rate is given by $$w_t = f(k_{t}) - f^\\prime (k_{t}) = (1-\\alpha)Ak_{t}^\\alpha$$\nand the savings function is obtained solving $$u^\\prime(w_{t} - s_{t}) = \\beta R_{t+1} u^\\prime (R_{t+1}s_{t}).$$\nRearranging and isolating $s$ we are left with the savings function\n$$s_{t} = \\frac{\\beta}{1+\\beta}w_{t}.$$\nThe dynamics are given by the capital accumulation law\n$$k_{t+1} = \\frac{1}{1+n}s_{t} = \\frac{1}{1+n}\\frac{\\beta}{1+\\beta}w_{t} = \\frac{1}{1+n}\\frac{\\beta}{1+\\beta}(1-\\alpha)Ak_{t}^\\alpha.$$\nThe model with log-utility and Cobb-Douglas production functions has two steady states: zero and a unique positive steady state. We can solve for them:\n$$\\bar{k} = \\frac{1}{1+n}\\frac{\\beta}{1+\\beta}(1-\\alpha)A\\bar{k}^\\alpha \\implies \\bar{k} = \\begin{cases} 0 \\\\\\ \\left(\\frac{1}{1+n}\\frac{\\beta}{1+\\beta}(1-\\alpha)A\\right)^{\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}} \\equiv \\phi^\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}\\end{cases}.$$\nLocal dynamics: stability\nWe check the stability of the two steady states using the first derivative evaluated at the steady state. Note: in general we would use the Jacobian matrix, but the OLG model has only one equation in one variable.\nRemember that, for a discrete-time system, a non-hyperbolic steady state is stable if it the determinant of the Jacobian (here the absolute value of the derivative) evaluated at the steady state is in the unit circle $(-1, 1).$\nIn our case:\n$$g(k) = k_{t+1} = \\frac{1}{1+n}\\frac{\\beta}{1+\\beta}(1-\\alpha)Ak_{t}^\\alpha$$ $$g^\\prime(k) = \\frac{1}{1+n}\\frac{\\beta}{1+\\beta}(1-\\alpha)\\alpha Ak_{t}^{\\alpha-1}\u0026gt; 0.$$\nThen\n$$\\bar{k}=0 \\implies g^\\prime (0) = + \\infty \\quad \\rightarrow \\mathrm{unstable}$$ $$\\bar{k}=\\phi^\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha} \\implies g^\\prime(\\phi^\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}) = \\phi \\alpha \\phi^\\frac{\\alpha-1}{1-\\alpha} = \\alpha \\in (0,1) \\quad \\rightarrow \\mathrm{stable}.$$\nGlobal dynamics\nSuppose we have $k_{t+1} \\geq k_{t}$. We show that the dynamics are bounded above by the steady state $\\bar{k} = \\phi^\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}.$\n$$k_{t+1} \\geq k_{t} \\Leftrightarrow g(k_t) \\geq k_t \\Leftrightarrow \\phi k_t^\\alpha \\geq k_t \\Leftrightarrow \\phi \\geq k_t^{1-\\alpha} \\Leftrightarrow \\bar{k} \\geq k_t.$$\nLog-utility and CES technology Under a CES specification, $y_{t} = A \\left[ \\alpha k_{t}^\\rho + (1-\\alpha) \\right]^\\frac{1}{\\rho}, \\rho \\leq 1$ wages are given by $$\\omega_{t} = (1-\\alpha)\\left[\\alpha k^\\rho + 1 -\\alpha \\right]^{\\frac{1-\\rho}{\\rho}}.$$ Hence, the dynamics of capital are governed by:\n$$k_{t+1} = g(k_t) = \\frac{1}{1+n}s_{t} = \\frac{1}{1+n}\\frac{\\beta}{1+\\beta}A(1-\\alpha)\\left[\\alpha k_{t}^\\rho + 1 - \\alpha\\right]^\\frac{1-\\rho}{\\rho}.$$ The curve $g(k)$ is increasing:\n$$g^\\prime (k) = \\frac{\\beta A (1-\\alpha)}{(1+n)(1+\\beta )}(1-\\rho)\\left[ \\alpha k^\\rho + 1 - \\alpha \\right]^\\frac{1-2 \\rho}{\\rho}k^{\\rho -1} \u0026gt; 0.$$\nDepending on the value of $\\rho$ we can have different configurations regarding the steady states. Ultimately, what matters is the concavity of the function $g(k_{t}).$\n$$g^{\\prime \\prime}(k_t) = -\\frac{1}{1+n}\\frac{\\beta}{1+\\beta}A(1-\\rho)\\alpha\\left[\\alpha k^\\rho+1-\\alpha\\right]^\\frac{1-3\\rho}{\\rho}k^{\\rho-2}\\left(\\rho \\alpha k^\\rho +(1-\\alpha)(1-\\rho)\\right).$$\nUnique steady state, $\\bar{k} \u0026gt; 0$ If $\\rho \\in (0,1)$, the second derivative is clearly negative, and $g$ is concave. Moreover, $g(0)\u0026gt;0$, so $\\bar{k} = 0$ cannot be a steady state:\n$$g(k_{t}) = \\frac{\\beta A(1-\\alpha)}{(1+n)(1+\\beta)}(\\alpha k^\\rho + 1 - \\alpha)^\\frac{1-\\rho}{\\rho} \\implies g(0)=\\frac{\\beta A(1-\\alpha)^\\frac{1}{\\rho}}{(1+n)(1+\\beta)}\u0026gt; 0.$$ In that case, the economy displays a unique steady state, and it is globally stable.\nUnique $\\bar{k}=0$ or multiple steady states If $\\rho \u0026lt; 0,$ the function $g(k)$ changes concavity. In particular, there exists a level $\\hat{k}$ such that: $$g^{\\prime \\prime}(k) \u0026gt; 0, \\mathrm{if} , k \u0026lt; \\hat{k}.$$ $$g^{\\prime \\prime}(k) \u0026lt; 0, \\mathrm{if} , k \u0026gt; \\hat{k}.$$ with $$\\hat{k} = \\left( - \\frac{(1-\\alpha)(1-\\rho)}{\\rho \\alpha}\\right)^\\frac{1}{\\rho} \u0026gt; 0 , \\mathrm{since}, \\rho \u0026lt;0.$$ Moreover, $g(0)=0$ so $\\bar{k}=0$ can be a steady state.\nIn this case, there are two sub-cases:\n  If $k_{t+1} \u0026lt; k_{t} \\implies \\frac{\\omega(k)}{k} \u0026lt; (1+n)\\frac{1+\\beta}{\\beta}$ then the trajectory of $k_{t+1}$ is always below $k$. Then, there is one unique steady state: $\\bar{k}=0.$ The economy converges towards this unique steady state. We can derive the condition above from: $\\begin{align} k_{t+1} \u0026lt; k_{t} \u0026amp; \\implies \\frac{1}{1+n}s\\left(\\omega(k_{t}),R_{t+1}\\right) \u0026lt; k_{t} \\implies \\\\\\\n\\frac{1}{1+n}\\frac{\\beta}{1+\\beta}w_t \u0026lt; k_{t} \u0026amp; \\implies \\frac{w_{t}}{k_{t}} \u0026lt; (1+n)\\frac{1+\\beta}{\\beta}. \\end{align}$\n  If there is some $k_{t+1} \u0026gt; k_{t} \\implies \\frac{\\omega(k)}{k} \u0026gt; (1+n)\\frac{1+\\beta}{\\beta}$ then there are two positive steady states $\\bar{k}_{a} \u0026lt; \\bar{k}_{b}$ plus the zero steady state $\\bar{k}=0.$\n All trajectories starting at $k_0 \u0026lt; \\bar{k}_{a}$ converge to $\\bar{k}=0$ and $\\bar{k}=0$ is locally stable in the range $[0,\\bar{k}_{a}].$ The steady state with $\\bar{k}=0$ is a poverty trap: whenever the economy starts with a low enough level of capital, it will always converge towards the $\\bar{k}=0$ steady state. Trajectories starting at $k_0=\\bar{k}_{a}$ remain at $\\bar{k}_{a}$. This steady state is unstable. Finally, trajectories starting with $k_0 \u0026gt; \\bar{k}_{a}$ converge towards $\\bar{k}_{b}$, which is a locally stable steady state in $(\\bar{k}_{a}, +\\infty).$      The mean value theorem states that, for a continuous function on $[a,b],$ there is a point $c \\in (a,b)$ such that the derivative a $c, f^\\prime( c)$ coincides with the slope of the secant between $a$ and $b, \\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a}.$ More information. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1562803200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562803200,"objectID":"06f2c4e4de3ff101365cddd3d2d9106c","permalink":"https://eric-roca.github.io/courses/olg/steady_state/","publishdate":"2019-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/olg/steady_state/","section":"courses","summary":"We assume that the intertemporal equilibrium exists and is unique.

The set of points $(c,k)$ implying a constant consumption is called the $c$-locus. Similarly, we have the $k$-locus.\nThese loci are curves on the $(c,k)$ plane, and any intersection between them is a steady state because both $c$ and $k$ are simultaneously constant. The phase diagram is a useful tool to analyse the behaviour of a dynamic system because it indicates the direction of movement of the variables at any point on the plane.\nThe dynamics of $c$ The first equation of \\ref{eq:eq} describes the dynamics of consumption.\n$$u^{\\prime}(c_{t}) = \\beta ( f^{\\prime}(k_{t+1}) + 1 - \\delta) u^{\\prime}(c_{t+1}).$$\nRearranging it we arrive at:\n$$\\frac{u^{\\prime}(c_{t})}{u^{\\prime}(c_{t+1})} = \\beta ( f^{\\prime}(k_{t+1}) + 1 - \\delta).$$\nIn the phase diagram we want to plot combinations of $(c,k)$ such that $c$ is constant. Constant consumption implies $c_t = c_{t+1} \\implies \\frac{u^\\prime (c_t)}{u^\\prime (c_{t+1})} = 1.$ Therefore, the $c$-locus is\n$$ 1 = \\beta ( f^{\\prime}(k_{t+1}) + 1 - \\delta)$$\nand any level of capital satisfying it implies constant consumption. This condition depends only on the level of capital.\nDenote such level $k^{\\star}$. When $k \u0026lt; k^{\\star}, f^{\\prime}(k) \u0026gt; f^{\\prime}(k^{\\star})$, implying that $u^{\\prime}(c_{t}) \u0026gt; u^{\\prime}(c_{t+1})$ and hence consumption will raise over time. Similarly, if $k \u0026gt; k^{\\star}$ implies that consumption falls. Note: remember that we are looking at $f^{\\prime}(k)$ and $u^{\\prime}(c)$, not $k$ and $c.$ This information is summarised in the following Figure.\nThe arrows show the direction in which consumption $c$ evolves. As discussed before, consumption raises when capital is below $k^{\\star}$ and raises when above. Note the vertical line: it denotes the level of capital $k^{\\star}$ such that $c$ is constant. The value $k^{\\star}$ can be easily computed: $k^{\\star} = {f^{\\prime}}^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1-\\beta (1-\\delta)}{\\beta}\\right).$\nThe dynamics of $k$ We can proceed similarly with the motion of capital. The relevant equation in this case is:\n$$k_{t+1} = f(k_{t}) + (1- \\delta)k_{t} - c_{t}.$$\nAs before, we are interested in the combinations of $(k,c)$ such that capital remains constant over time. In this case, though, and contrasting with the previous, we will obtain that both capital and consumption affect capital levels in the future: production uses current capital, and current consumption depletes current production. We can rearrange the previous equation to obtain the following:\n$$k_{t+1} - k_{t} = f(k_{t}) - \\delta k_{t} - c_{t}.$$ Setting $k_{t+1} = k_{t} \\implies k_{t+1} - k_{t} = 0$ so capital is constant yields:\n$$ 0 = f(k_{t}) - \\delta k_{t} - c_{t} \\implies c_{t} = f(k_{t}) - \\delta k_{t}.$$\nIn the $(k,c)$ space, the equation takes a form similar to a parabola: it combines production \u0026mdash;with decreasing marginal returns\u0026mdash; with a linear depreciation rate. In fact, f(k_t)-\\delta k_t$ admits one maximum $(f^\\prime (k_t) = \\delta)$ the Golden rule we discuss later. Since $f^{\\prime \\prime}(k_t)\u0026lt;0,$ the stationary point is a maximum.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s now analyse how capital evolves when consumption is above and below the level that makes it constant. From $k_{t+1} - k_{t} = f(k_{t}) - \\delta k_{t} - c_{t}$, if consumption is above the level we have that $k_{t+1} - k_{t} \u0026lt; 0,$ meaning that capital decreases over time. The opposite applies when consumption is below the level that guarantees a constant level of capital. The Figure below summarises these findings:\nThe phase diagram We can combine the information above to produce the phase diagram. It indicates the motion of variables at different points of the $(k,c)$ space.\nThe arrows show the motion of each variable at different combinations of $(k,c).$ For instance, to the left of the $c$-locus and above the $k0$-locus consumption increases and capital decreases. Finally, the point indicating the intersection of both curves is the steady state: all variables remain constant at their values.\n","date":1562803200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562803200,"objectID":"bfb9958a4b71fb1354d4cea401388c7f","permalink":"https://eric-roca.github.io/courses/ramsey/phase_diagram/","publishdate":"2019-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/ramsey/phase_diagram/","section":"courses","summary":"Note: based on Section 2.3 of Romer, Advanced Macroeconomics.\nThe Ramsey model is fully described by two dynamic equations:\n$$\\left. \\begin{eqnarray} u^{\\prime}(c_{t}) = \\beta(f^{\\prime}(k_{t+1}) + 1 - \\delta)u^{\\prime}(c_{t+1}), \\\\\\\nk_{t+1} = f(k_{t} + (1-\\delta)k_{t} - c_{t}.","tags":null,"title":"The phase diagram","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In the OLG model, a unique intertemporal equilibrium arises if, for a given $k_t$, the equation\n$$H(k_{t+1}) = k_{t+1} - \\frac{1}{1+n}s\\left(\\omega(k_t), f^\\prime(k_{t+1})\\right) = 0$$\nhas a unique solution.

In fact, if that were the case it would have been (I change variables to avoid confusion):\n$$\\begin{pmatrix} \\phi_{t+1} \\\\ \\omega_{t+1} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a_{1,1} \u0026amp; 0 \\\\\\ 0 \u0026amp; a_{2,2} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\phi_{t} \\\\\\ \\omega_{t} \\end{pmatrix}.$$ So, it is clear that $\\phi_{t+1} = a_{1,1} \\phi_{t} \\implies \\phi_{t} = a_{1,1}^{t} \\phi_{0}$ and we would find a similar expression for $\\omega.$\n$\\bar{A}$ is not diagonal, but we can apply a spectral decomposition and obtain an equivalent system governed by a diagonal matrix. In particular, we are looking for an $2 \\times 2$ invertible matrix $X$ such that $ X^{-1} \\bar{A} X = `Lambda$, where $\\Lambda$ is diagonal. We will then apply the following transformation to our system (pre-multiplying by $\\color{red}{X^{-1}}$ on both sides and multiplying by $\\color{green}{XX^{-1}}$ on the right-hand side). $$ \\color{red}{X^{-1}} y_{t+1} = \\color{red}{X^{-1}} \\bar{A} \\color{green}{(X X^{-1})} y_{t} = X^{-1} \\bar{A} X (X^{-1} y_{t}) =$$ $$ = \\Lambda X^{-1} y_{t}.$$\nDenote $z \\equiv X^{-1} y$. Thus, the system becomes:\n$$z_{t+1} = \\Lambda z_{t}.$$ Since $\\Lambda$ is diagonal, the solutions are of the form: $$z_{t} = \\Lambda^{t} z_{0}.$$ Note: in general, the power of a matrix is complex. However, for a diagonal matrix it is simply the power of each component.\nOnce we have the solution for the transformed system we must undo the transformation: in fact, we do not care about the evolution of $z$. This step involves using that $X^{-1} y = z \\implies y = X z$.\nThe matrix $\\Lambda$ In a spectral decomposition, the diagonal matrix $\\Lambda$ consists of the matrix whose entries are its eigenvalues. Thus (we have a $2 \\times 2$ system), $$\\Lambda = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda_{1} \u0026amp; 0 \\\\\\\n0 \u0026amp; \\lambda_{2} \\end{pmatrix}.$$\nThe matrix $X$ The matrix $X$ has as columns the eigenvectors of $\\bar{A}.$ There is one eigenvector associated with each eigenvalue. Note: it is important to correctly relate each eigenvector to its eigenvalue.\nTo find an eigenvector associated with $\\lambda_{1}$ (there are infinitely many possible eigenvectors, we only want one) we solve the following system:\n$$\\bar{A} \\begin{pmatrix} v_{1} \\\\\\ v_{2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\lambda_{1} \\begin{pmatrix} v_{1} \\\\\\ v_{2} \\end{pmatrix} \\quad \\mathrm{or} \\quad (\\bar{A} - \\lambda_{1} \\mathbb{I}) \\begin{pmatrix} v_{1} \\\\\\ v_{2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}.$$\nThe matrix $X$ then becomes:\n$$X = \\begin{pmatrix} v_{1,1} \u0026amp; v_{2,1} \\\\\\ 1 \u0026amp; 1 \\end{pmatrix}.$$\nSolving the system We begin with the solution for the transformed variable $z.$ We already know it takes the form:\n$$z_{t} = \\Lambda^{t} z_{0} \\quad \\mathrm{or} \\quad \\begin{pmatrix} z_{t}^{1} \\\\\\ z_{t}^{2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda_{1}^{t} \u0026amp; 0 \\\\\\ 0 \u0026amp; \\lambda_{2}^{t} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_{0}^{1} \\\\\\ v_{0}^{2} \\end{pmatrix}.$$\nNext, we reverse the transformation, this is, we obtain the dynamics of $y: y_{t} = X z_{t}.$ Therefore, we obtain:\n$$y_{t} = X z_{t} = X \\Lambda^{t} z_{0} = \\begin{pmatrix} v_{1,1} \u0026amp; v_{2,1} \\\\\\ v_{1,2} \u0026amp; v_{2,2} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda_{1}^{t} \u0026amp; 0 \\\\\\ 0 \u0026amp; \\lambda_{2}^{t} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} z_{0}^{1} \\\\\\ z_{0}^{2} \\end{pmatrix}.$$\nAlternatively, multiplying the matrices and recalling that $y_{t}=\\begin{pmatrix} c_{t} - \\bar{c} \\\\\\ k_{t} - \\bar{k} \\end{pmatrix}$ :\n$$\\begin{pmatrix} c_{t} - \\bar{c} \\\\\\ k_{t} - \\bar{k} \\end{pmatrix} = z_{0}^{1} \\lambda_{1}^{t} \\begin{pmatrix} v_{1,1} \\\\\\ v_{1,2} \\end{pmatrix} + z_{0}^{2} \\lambda_{2}^{t} \\begin{pmatrix} v_{2,1} \\\\\\ v_{2,2} \\end{pmatrix}.$$\nThe eigenvalues appear clearly in the solution. Remember that we know that one eigenvalue is bigger than one, while the second lies within the unit circle. Without loss of generality, assume that $\\lambda_{1} \\in (-1,1)$ and $\\lambda_{2} \u0026gt; 1.$ According to the solution before, this implies an explosive behaviour: $\\lambda_{2} \u0026gt; 1 \\implies \\lim_{t \\rightarrow +\\infty} \\lambda_{2}^{t} = +\\infty.$ To have well-behaved dynamics we must impose $z_{0}^{2} = 0$, which eliminates explosive behaviour.\nAfter imposing $z_{0}^{2} = 0$ the system becomes:\n$$\\begin{pmatrix} c_{t} - \\bar{c} \\\\\\ k_{t} - \\bar{k} \\end{pmatrix} = z_{0}^{1} \\lambda_{1}^{t} \\begin{pmatrix} v_{1,1} \\\\\\ v_{1,2} \\end{pmatrix}.$$\nClosing the model with initial values We know that the economy begins with a level of capital $k_{t=0} = k_{0} \u0026gt; 0.$ Substituting $t=0$ in the equation above, and focusing on capital, we obtain:\n$$k_{0} - \\bar{k} = z_{0}^{1} v_{1,2} \\implies \\color{red}{z_{0}^{1} = \\frac{k_{0} - \\bar{k}}{v_{1,2}}}.$$ Therefore, we can substitute the value for $z_{0}^{1}$ to obtain the dynamics of capital:\n$$k_{t} - \\bar{k} = \\color{red}{z_{0}^{1}} \\lambda_{1}^{t} v_{1,2} = \\left(k_{0} - \\bar{k} \\right) \\lambda^{t}.$$\nSimilarly,for consumption we have:\n$$c_{t} - \\bar{c} = \\color{red}{z_{0}^{1}} \\lambda_{1}^{t} v_{1,1} = \\frac{v_{1,1}}{v_{1,2}} \\lambda_{1}^{t} (k_{0} - \\bar{k}).$$ Finally, the initial value of consumption $c_{0}$ that puts the economy in the saddle path is obtained by setting $t=0$ in the previous equation:\n$$c_{0} - \\bar{c} = \\frac{v_{1,1}}{v_{1,2}} (k_{0} - \\bar{k}).$$\n","date":1562803200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562803200,"objectID":"d02c63fc1a16c03ec330da6d45a24951","permalink":"https://eric-roca.github.io/courses/ramsey/ramsey_trajectory/","publishdate":"2019-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/ramsey/ramsey_trajectory/","section":"courses","summary":"The trajectory around the steady state For the moment, we have established that the model converges towards a unique steady state following a saddle path.

First, we write down the household\u0026rsquo;s budget constraint:\nHousehold\u0026rsquo;s budget constraint At each period, the total received income is composed of wages and interest. It can be spent on consumption or saving. Remember that capital depreciates at a rate $\\delta \\in [0,1].$ Hence, we receive back from firms $1-\\delta$ times the capital we lend. Therefore:\n$$ w_{t} + r_{t}k_{t} + (1-\\delta)k_{t} = c_{t} + k _{t+1}.$$\nIntertemporal utility maximisation: Lagrangian The intertemporal utility maximisation problem is:\n$$\\begin{eqnarray} \\max_{c_{t}, k_{t+1}} \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\beta^{t} u(c_{t}) \u0026amp; \\\\\\\n\\mathrm{s.t.} \\quad w_{t} + r_{t} k_{t} + (1-\\delta)k_{t} = c_{t} + k_{t+1}, \\\\\\\nc_{t}, k_{t+1} \u0026gt;0, k_{t=0} = k_{0} \u0026gt; 0. \\end{eqnarray} $$\nThe Lagrangian becomes:\n$$ \\mathcal{L} = \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\beta^{t} u(c_{t}) + \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\lambda_{t}(w_{t} + (r_{t} + 1 - \\delta)k_{t} - c_{t} - k_{t+1}).$$\nWe use the first-order conditions with respect to $c_{t}$ and $k_{t+1}$ to find the optimal consumption path: the Euler equation, which we combine later with the transversality condition.\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial c_{t}} = \\beta^{t} u^{\\prime}(c_{t}) - \\lambda_{t} = \\beta^{t}\\frac{1}{c_{t}} - \\lambda_{t} = 0$$ $$\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial k_{t+1}} = -\\lambda_{t} + \\lambda_{t+1} (r_{t+1} + 1 - \\delta) = 0.$$\nCombining both, we obtain the Euler equation:\n$$\\beta^{t}\\frac{1}{c_{t}} = r_{t+1} \\beta^{t+1} \\frac{1}{c_{t+1}} \\implies c_{t+1} = \\beta (r_{t} + 1 - \\delta)c_{t}.$$\nFinally, we should remember to impose the transversality condition:\n$$\\lim_{t \\rightarrow +\\infty} \\beta^{t}u^{\\prime}(c_{t})k_{t+1} = \\lim_{t \\rightarrow +\\infty}\\beta^{t}\\frac{1}{c_{t}}k_{t+1} = 0.$$\nFirm\u0026rsquo;s optimisation In this model, firms operate under perfect competition, making zero profits.

A steady-state $(\\bar{k}, \\bar{c})$ is such that capital and consumption remain constant over time: $c_{t+1} = c_{t}$ and $k_{t+1} = k_{t}.$ Applying this idea to the equations above we get \u0026mdash;here we can temporarily forget about the transversality condition.\n$$\\bar{c} = \\beta(\\alpha \\bar{k}^{\\alpha-1} + 1 - \\delta) \\bar{c},$$ $$\\bar{k}^{\\alpha} + (1-\\delta)\\bar{k} = \\bar{c} + \\bar{k}.$$\nUsing the first equation we can easily get the steady level of capital:\n$$ \\bar{k} = \\left(\\frac{\\alpha \\beta}{1-\\beta(1-\\delta)}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}}.$$\nApplying $\\bar{k}$ in the second equation yields the steady-state level of consumption:\n$$ \\bar{c} = \\left(\\frac{\\alpha \\beta}{1-\\beta (1-\\delta)}\\right)^{\\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha}} - \\delta \\left(\\frac{\\alpha \\beta}{1-\\beta (1- \\delta)}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}}.$$\nStability First, we analyse the stability of the steady state, as we did in the general case Since we are using log-utility, the coefficient of relative risk aversion $\\epsilon_{c} = 1.$\nInstead of plugging the correct values in the Jacobian matrix $\\bar{A}$, for the sake of clarity, we derive everything again:\n$$\\bar{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial c_{t+1}}{\\partial c_{t}} \u0026amp; \\frac{\\partial c_{t+1}}{\\partial k_{t}} \\\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial k_{t+1}}{\\partial c_{t}} \u0026amp; \\frac{\\partial k_{t+1}}{\\partial k_{t}} \\end{pmatrix} $$ $$ = $$ $$\\begin{pmatrix} \\beta \\left( \\alpha k_{t+1}^{\\alpha -1} + 1 - \\delta \\right) - \\frac{\\beta c_{t} \\alpha (\\alpha-1) }{k_{t+1}^{2-\\alpha}} \u0026amp; \\frac{\\beta c_{t} \\alpha (\\alpha -1)}{k_{t+1}^{2-\\alpha}} \\left( \\alpha k_{t}^{\\alpha-1} + 1 - \\delta \\right) \\\\\\\n-1 \u0026amp; \\alpha k_{t}^{\\alpha -1} + 1 - \\delta \\end{pmatrix}$$\nEvaluating it at the steady state: $$\\bar{A}\\bigr\\rvert_{\\substack{ k_{t} = k_{t+1} = \\bar{k} \\\\\\\nc_{t} = c_{t+1} = \\bar{c} } } = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 - \\beta \\bar{c} \\alpha (\\alpha -1) \\bar{k}^{\\alpha -2} \u0026amp; \\alpha (\\alpha -1 ) \\bar{c} \\bar{k}^{\\alpha -2} \\\\\\\n-1 \u0026amp; \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\end{pmatrix},$$\nwhere we have used $1 = \\beta \\left( \\alpha \\bar{k}^{\\alpha -1} + 1 - \\delta \\right)$ at the steady state.\nEigenvalues We can use the fact $\\mathrm{tr}(\\bar{A}) = \\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2}, \\mathrm{det}(\\bar{A}) = \\lambda_{1} \\lambda_{2}.$ Therefore:\n$$\\lambda_{1} \\lambda_{2} = \\frac{1}{\\beta} $$ $$\\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2} = \\frac{1}{\\beta} + 1 - \\beta \\bar{c} \\alpha (\\alpha-1) \\bar{k}^{\\alpha -2}.$$ The first equation implies that either a) $\\lambda_{1} \u0026gt; 0, \\lambda_{2} \u0026gt; 0$ or b) $\\lambda_{1} \u0026lt; 0, \\lambda_{2} \u0026lt; 0.$ However, since $\\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2} \u0026gt; 1$ b) is impossible. Then, $\\lambda_{1} \u0026gt; 0, \\lambda_{2} \u0026gt; 0.$ Substitute $\\lambda_{1} \\lambda_{2} = \\frac{1}{\\beta} $ in the second equation:\n$$ \\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2} = 1+ \\lambda_{1} \\lambda_{2} - \\beta ( \\alpha (\\alpha - 1) \\bar{k}^{\\alpha -2}\\frac{\\bar{c}}{\\epsilon_{\\bar{c}}}.$$\nRearranging: $$ \\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2} - \\lambda_{1} \\lambda_{2} = 1+ - \\beta \\alpha (\\alpha -1) \\bar{k}^{\\alpha -2}\\frac{\\bar{c}}{\\epsilon_{\\bar{c}}} \u0026gt; 1 \\implies \\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2} - \\lambda_{1}\\lambda_{2} - 1 \u0026gt;0.$$ Factorisation leads to: $$(1 - \\lambda_{2})(\\lambda_{1} - 1) \u0026gt; 0.$$ Therefore, since $\\lambda_1,, \\lambda_2 \u0026gt;0: $$ \\lambda_{2} \u0026lt; 1 \\implies \\lambda_{1} \\in (0,1)$$ $$ \\lambda_{1} \u0026gt; 1 \\implies \\lambda_{2} \\in (1,+\\infty)$$ and the steady state is saddle.\nTrajectory Describing the trajectory around the steady state analytically would be cumbersome. One possibility is to introduce an alternative production function of the $Ak$ family which alleviates this problem, see the notes by Maurice Obsfeld\nInstead, we solve this section numerically. In particular, assume that $\\alpha = 0.3, \\, \\beta = 0.9, \\, \\delta = 0.1.$ The initial level of capital $k_{t=0} = 1.$\nWith these values, we have the following:\n$$\\bar{k} = 1.65202, \\, \\bar{c}=0.997329, \\, \\bar{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.08029 \u0026amp; -0.089214 \\\\\\ -1 \u0026amp; 1.11111 \\end{pmatrix}.$$\nThe eigenvalues of the matrix $\\bar{A}$ are $$\\lambda_{1} = 0.796618 \\in (-1,1)$$ $$\\lambda_{2} =1.39479 \u0026gt; 1.$$\nOne possible set of eigenvectors is given by:\n$$v_{1} = (0.314494 , 1), v_{2} = (-0.283675, 1)$$ which are associated with $\\lambda_{1}$ and $\\lambda_{2}$, respectively. Hence, the matrix $X$ becomes:\n$$X = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.314494 \u0026amp; -0.283675 \\\\\\ 1 \u0026amp; 1 \\end{pmatrix}.$$\nSolving the system Applying the results from before the system is:\n$$\\begin{pmatrix} c_{t} - \\bar{c} \\\\\\ k_{t} - \\bar{k} \\end{pmatrix} = z_{0}^{1}, 0.796618^{t} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.314494 \\\\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + z_{0}^{2}, 1.39479 \\begin{pmatrix} -0.283675 \\\\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}.$$\nSince $\\lambda_{2} \u0026gt; 1$ we must set the value $z_{0}^{2} = 0$ to avoid explosive behaviour. Consequently:\n$$\\begin{pmatrix} c_{t} - \\bar{c} \\\\\\ k_{t} - \\bar{k} \\end{pmatrix} = z_{0}^{1}, 0.796618^{t} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.314494 \\\\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}.$$\nTo solve the system of equations, first set $t=0$ and focus on $k_t - \\bar{k}.$\n$$\\underbrace{k_{0}}_{=1} - \\underbrace{\\bar{k}}_{=1.65202} = z_{0}^{1} \\times 1= -0.652017.$$\nHence, capital dynamics are governed by\n$k_{t} - \\bar{k} = -0.652017 \\times 0.796618^{t}$\nThe law of motion of consumption becomes\n$c_{t} - \\bar{c} = -0.652017 \\times 0.314494 \\times 0.796618^{t} = -0.205055 \\times 0.786618^{t}.$\nFinally, we solve for the initial level of consumption compatible with the saddle path.

However, the first welfare theorem has two requisites the Diamond model does not meet: a finite number of goods and a finite number of agents. Therefore, the allocation resulting from the competitive equilibrium may not be Pareto optimal.\nThe golden-rule level of capital We begin the discussion by bringing back the idea of over- and under-accumulation of capital we have seen before. In the Diamond model \u0026mdash;and different from the Ramsey model\u0026mdash;, the capital stock on the balanced growth path may exceed the golden-rule level. This implies that a permanent increase in consumption is possible.\nWhen discussing the golden-rule level of capital, we are not interested in how consumption is divided between the old and the young. Rather, we seek to maximise total consumption during one period. In fact, if we maximise total consumption, the ensuing allocations between young and old will be efficient. First, let $\\mathfrak{C}_t$ represent total consumption: $$\\mathfrak{C}_t \\equiv C_t + D_t.$$ The economy-wide resource constraint dictates that total production is either consumed or invested:\n$$\\mathfrak{C}_t + K_{t+1} = F(K_t, N_t)+ (1-\\delta)K_t.$$\nAlternatively, aggregate consumption per unit of labour is:\n$$\\mathfrak{c}_t \\equiv \\frac{\\mathfrak{C}_t}{N_t} = \\frac{F(K_t, N_t) +(1-\\delta)K_t - K_{t+1}}{N_t} = f(k_t) + (1-\\delta)k_t - (1+n)k_{t+1}.$$\nThe golden-rule level of the capital-labour ratio $k^\\mathcal{GR}$ is the value of the capital-labour ratio $k$ that results in the highest possible sustainable level of consumption per unit of labour. The fact that it is sustainable requires that it is replicable forever. For this reason, we consider the steady state with $k_{t+1} = k_t = \\bar{k}$. The resource constraint at the steady state simplifies to:\n$$\\bar{\\mathfrak{c}} = f(\\bar{k})-(\\delta + n)\\bar{k} \\equiv \\mathfrak{c}(k).$$\nWe maximise this function with respect to $\\bar{k}$:\n$$\\mathfrak{c}^\\prime(\\bar{k}) = f^\\prime (\\bar{k}) - (n+\\delta) = 0$$ The fact that $\\mathfrak{c}^{\\prime \\prime}(\\bar{k}) = f^{\\prime \\prime}(\\bar{k})\u0026lt;0$ assures that we have the maximum.\nAssuming that $n+\\delta \u0026gt;0$ and that $f$ satisfies:\n$$\\lim_{k \\rightarrow +\\infty} f^\\prime(k) \u0026lt; n+ \\delta \u0026lt; \\lim_{k \\rightarrow 0} f^\\prime(k),$$\nthen $\\mathfrak{c}^\\prime(\\bar{k}) = f^\\prime (\\bar{k}) - (n+\\delta) = 0$ has a solution in $\\bar{k}$ and it is unique. Hence, the golden-rule level of capital is given by:\n$$f^\\prime(k^\\mathcal{GR}) = n + \\delta.$$\nThe highest sustainable consumption level per unit of labour is obtained when, at steady state, the net marginal productivity of capital equals the growth rate of the economy.\nOver- and under-accumulation of capital The golden-rule level of capital is given by $f^\\prime(k) = n+\\delta.$ However, in the decentralised economy, the steady-state level of savings is highly unlikely to coincide with it. For instance, a log-utility function coupled with a Cobb-Douglas production function leads to a steady-state value of capital such that $f^\\prime (k) = \\frac{\\beta}{(1+n)(1+\\beta)}^\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}.$ In general, $\\frac{\\beta}{(1+n)(1+\\beta)}^\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha} \\neq n+\\delta.$\nIf the steady-state level of the economy is such that $f^\\prime (\\bar{k}) \u0026lt; n+ \\delta,$ the economy has accumulated too much capital: if $f^\\prime (\\bar{k}) \u0026lt; f^\\prime(k^\\mathcal{GR}) \\implies \\bar{k} \u0026gt; k^\\mathcal{GR}.$ Conversely, if the interest rate at the competitive steady state is such that $f^\\prime (\\bar{k}) \u0026gt; n + \\delta,$ then it lacks capital compared to the golden rule.\nImproving the situation: dynamic inefficiency Let\u0026rsquo;s suppose for the moment that the decentralised economy reaches a situation of over-accumulation of capital, this is, $f^\\prime(\\bar{k}) \u0026lt; n + \\delta.$ It is possible to improve upon it by means of redistribution. Simply, a planner could order young individuals to save less, as to reach $k^\\mathcal{GR}.$ Doing so increases the available total output per worker, which can be consumed either by the old or the young, improving their utility. In subsequent periods, the economy would remain at $k^\\mathcal{GR}$, which maximises total output per worker.\nIn particular, assume we impose a lump-sum tax on all young individuals and we transfer it to the old generation. The transfer is fully consumed (old individuals gain utility from consuming it). Suppose the transfer is one good from each young to the old. There are $1+n$ young individuals per old individual, so the old receive $1+n$ goods. Let\u0026rsquo;s repeat this scheme every period.\n The young transfer one good to the old Consumption of the young does not change because they refrain from saving. In the future, they receive $1+n$, which represents a return rate of $1+n$ on their \u0026ldquo;investment\u0026rdquo;. In the competitive market, they would have obtained $f^\\prime(k) \u0026lt; n + \\delta.$ Clearly, the return young individuals achieve under the tax system is larger, and hence they are better off.  At the same time, old individuals are also better off. In the first period, when the reform is introduced, they consume more. Later generations obtain a higher return for the tax they pay, leaving them better off, too.\nWhen organising such scheme is possible, we say that the competitive economy was dynamically inefficient.\nNote: it is possible to solve the dynamic inefficiency introducing money. Young individuals would exchange goods for paper notes with the expectation of exchanging them back again when old.\nDynamic efficiency In the opposite case, when $\\bar{k} \u0026lt; k^\\mathrm{GR}$, reaching the golden-rule level of capital requires increasing it. Suppose we are at time $t_0$. Increasing the capital to $k^\\mathcal{GR}$ would certainly improve consumption for all generations $t \u0026gt; t_0$. However, young individuals at $t_0$ should forgo some consumption to save more and build the necessary capital. Hence, the consumption of the young generation at $t_0$ necessarily decreases. Our policy of improving utility for all individuals fails in this case.\nWe call such situations dynamically efficient: it is impossible to increase the utility of all generations.\nExample We use a log-utility and Cobb-Douglas case to illustrate over- and under-accumulation of capital.\n$U(c,d) = \\log( c ) + \\beta \\log (d)$$ $$f(k)= Ak^\\alpha.$$\nThe golden-rule level of capital dictates that total consumption per worker should be maximised. Using the resource constraint:\n$$\\max \\mathcal{c_t}= f(k_t) +(1-\\delta)k_t - (1+n)k_{t+1}.$$\nEvaluating it at the steady state yields:\n$$\\max \\mathfrak{c} = f(k) - (n+\\delta)k \\implies f^\\prime(k^\\mathcal{GR}) = n+\\delta.$$\nHence, in our case:\n$$A \\alpha {k^\\mathcal{GR}}^{\\alpha-1} = n + \\delta \\implies k^\\mathcal{GR} = \\left(\\frac{A\\alpha}{n+\\delta}\\right)^\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}.$$\nIn the decentralised economy, we have that:\n$$k_{t+1} = \\frac{1}{1+n} s(\\omega(k_t), f^\\prime(k_{t+1})) = \\frac{1}{1+n}\\frac{\\beta}{1+\\beta}A(1-\\alpha)k_t^\\alpha.$$\nHence, the steady-state level of capital is:\n$$\\bar{k} = \\frac{A \\beta (1-\\alpha)}{(1+n)(1+\\beta )}\\bar{k}^\\alpha \\implies \\bar{k} = \\frac{A(1-\\alpha) \\beta}{(1+n)(1+\\beta)}^\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}.$$\nWe have capital over-accumulation if: $\\bar{k} \u0026gt; k^\\mathcal{GR} \\implies \\frac{(n+\\delta) \\beta}{(1+n)(1+\\beta)} \u0026gt; \\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha}.$\n Check Romer, pp. 89\u0026ndash;90 for an empirical discussion about the dynamic efficiency.\n","date":1562803200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562803200,"objectID":"301904135b3b1c74733315d00ad2acba","permalink":"https://eric-roca.github.io/courses/olg/optimality/","publishdate":"2019-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/olg/optimality/","section":"courses","summary":"Note: Based on de la Croix and Michel, Chapter 2 and Gorth\u0026rsquo;s lecture notes.\nThe first welfare theorem states that a competitive equilibrium is Pareto optimal.

Hence, whether public expenditures are financed using debt or taxes is irrelevant.\nIntuitively, forward-looking agents \u0026mdash;who shall live forever\u0026ndash; know that, if the government increases expenditures today without raising taxes, debt will be issued and taxes eventually increased to pay it off.\nHowever, as we shall see, in the OLG model, the Ricardian equivalence does not hold. Clearly, the main difference between the OLG and Ramsey models is that agents live only for two periods in the former. Suppose that the government decides to run a deficit today to increase public expenditures. Young and old individuals today are not that much affected because, when the government raises the taxes to pay the debt off, they would have already died. Instead, if the government decides to increase taxes today, it affects present-day young and old individuals.\nThe model with a government The government Suppose the government has public expenditures of $g_t$ per young individual. Total expenditures are then $G_t = N_t g_t.$ These public expenditures are financed by a lump-sum tax of $\\tau_t$, which is paid only by the young. Total revenues are $T_t = N_t \\tau_t.$ Finally, the government can have debt. The total outstanding debt is $B_t,$ and $b_t$ represents it per young terms. The government pays interest on the debt of the previous period: $R_t B_{t-1}.$\nWe can write the government\u0026rsquo;s budget constraint:\n$$G_t + R_t B_{t-1} = B_t + T_t.$$\nThe constraint, expressed in per capita terms, is:\n$$\\frac{G_t}{N_t} + R_t \\frac{B_{t-1}}{N_t} = \\frac{B_t}{N_t} + \\frac{T_t}{N_t} = $$ $$g_t + R_t \\underbrace{\\frac{B_{t-1}}{N_{t-1}}}_{b_{t-1}}\\underbrace{\\frac{N_{t-1}}{N_{t}}}_{\\frac{1}{1+n}} = b_t + \\tau_t = $$ $$g_t + R_t \\frac{b_{t-1}}{1+n} = b_t + \\tau_t $$\nAs a final note, government spending is unproductive: it does not affect the production function. Moreover, individuals do not derive utility from it. Finally, we assume that the government always honors its debt. In that sense, government debt is a riskless asset.\nIndividuals The budget constraint of a young individual who now pays taxes $\\tau_t$ is:\n$$w_t = c_t + s_t + \\tau_t$$ $$R_{t+1}s_t = d_{t+1}.$$\nAlternatively, we can express it as an intertemporal budget constraint:\n$$w_t = c_t + \\tau_t +\\frac{d_{t+1}}{R_{t+1}}.$$\nWe can easily obtain the savings function as we did before by substitution:\n$$\\max_{c_t, s_t, d_{t+1}} u(c_t) + \\beta u(d_{t+1})$$ $$\\mathrm{s.t.}, w_t = c_t + s_t - \\tau_t$$ $$\\phantom{\\mathrm{s.t.}}, d_{t+1} = R_{t+1}s_t.$$\nThen:\n$$\\max_{s_t} u(w_t-s_t-\\tau_t) + \\beta u(R_{t+1}s_t).$$\nThe first order condition reads:\n$$u^\\prime(w_t - s_t-\\tau_t) = \\beta R_{t+1} u^\\prime(R_{t+1}s_t).$$\nFrom here, we can recover the savings function:\n$$s_t = s(w_t-\\tau_t, R_{t+1}).$$\nIn this model, households have access to two types of savings:\n savings in capital and government bonds.  Moreover, the risk of both types of investment is the same: none, because both assets are riskless. Hence, bonds and capital are perfect substitutes. in the portfolio of wealth owners.1 Therefore, the entire amount households decide to save is split between the two\n$$N_t s_t = K_{t+1} + N_t b_t.$$\nEquilibrium At the (temporal) equilibrium , the government chooses $B_t, \\tau_t$ to satisfy its budget constraint: $g_t + R_t \\frac{b_{t-1}}{1+n} = b_t + \\tau_t.$ Moreover, as we have already discussed, because debt and capital are substitutes, both bear the same interest $R.$ Also, firms operate in a perfectly competitive environment and factors are paid their marginal productivities:\n$$w_t = \\omega(k_t)$$\nand $$R\\_t = f^\\prime(k\\_t)$$ with $k\\_t \\equiv \\frac{K\\_t}{N\\_t}.$ Introducing this into the government budget constraint we obtain:\n$$B_t + N_t \\tau_t = G_t + f^\\prime(\\color{red}{k_t})B_{t-1}.$$\nWe have implicitly assumed that investment is positive, this is, $$K_{t+1} = N_t s_t - B_t = N_t s(w_t - \\tau_t, R_{t+1}) - B_t \u0026gt;0.$$\nCapital thus evolves:\n$$K_{t+1} = N_t s_t - N_t b_t \\implies k_{t+1} = \\frac{1}{1+n} s(\\omega(k_t)-\\tau_t, R(k_{t+1})) - b_t.$$\nConstant deficit policy To simplify the analysis, we assume that the government faces constant expenditures $g_t = g$ and that the number of bonds is also constant: $b_t = b.$ The government can adjust the tax rate $\\tau_t$ each period. Therefore, the deficit at time $t$ is given by:\n$$\\mathcal{d}_t \\equiv g - \\tau_t = b\\left(1-\\frac{R_t}{1+n}\\right) = b\\left(\\frac{n+\\delta - r_t}{1+n}\\right),$$\nwhere we have used $R_t = 1 + r_t - \\delta$ together with the budget constraint of the government evaluated when $g_{t}=g$ and $b_{t}=b:$\n$$g + \\frac{b}{1+n}R_{t} = \\tau_{t} + b \\implies g - \\tau_{t} = b\\left(1-\\frac{R_{t}}{1+n}\\right).$$\nIf $n + \\delta \u0026gt; r_t$, then the government can be perpetually indebted while running a public deficit $g-\\tau_t.$ Otherwise, if $n + \\delta \u0026lt; r_t$, the government needs to run a budget surplus: $\\tau_t \u0026gt; g.$\nReplacing the new government budget $g - \\tau_t = b\\left(\\frac{n+\\delta - r_t}{1+n}\\right)$ in the equation for capital dynamics we obtain:\n$$k_{t+1} = \\frac{1}{1+n}s\\left(\\omega(k_t)-b\\frac{r(\\color{red}{k_t})-\\delta - n}{1+n}-g, R(\\color{green}{k_{t+1}})\\right)- \\frac{b}{1+n}.$$\nIn this case, the policy parameters $g, b$ affect the evolution of the capital stock. Notice also that if $b=g=0$ we recover the original version of the OLG model.\nSteady state For the moment, let\u0026rsquo;s assume that this model features, at least, one steady state. As usual, we denote its level of capital by $\\bar{k}.$\nAs before, we can compute how $k_{t+1}$ changes with $k_t.$\n$$\\frac{\\partial k_{t+1}}{\\partial k_t} = \\frac{s^\\prime_{\\omega}\\left(w^\\prime (k_t)-b\\frac{r^\\prime (k_t)}{1+n}\\right)}{1+n-s^\\prime_{R}R^\\prime (k_{t+1})}.$$\nSince $r^\\prime (k) \u0026lt;0$ we can already see that the speed at which capital adjusts in the presence of a government is larger than without it.\n$$\\frac{s^\\prime_{\\omega}\\left(\\omega^\\prime (k_t)-b\\frac{r^\\prime (k_t)}{1+n}\\right)}{1+n-s^\\prime_{R}R^\\prime (k_{t+1})} \u0026gt; \\frac{s^\\prime_{\\omega}\\omega^\\prime (k_t)}{1+n-s^\\prime_{R} R^\\prime(k_{t+1})}.$$\nAlso, notice that the numerator is positive: $\\omega^\\prime (k) - b \\frac{\\overbrace{r^\\prime(k)}^{\u0026lt;0}}{1+n} \u0026gt; 0.$ Hence,if $1+n-s^\\prime_{R}R^\\prime(k) \u0026gt; 0$ the dynamics will be monotonous. A sufficient condition is $s^\\prime_{R} \u0026gt; 0 \\implies \\sigma \u0026gt; 1.$ Let\u0026rsquo;s assume this condition is verified.\nStability We have assumed that a steady state exists. We analyse its stability. In particular, we should evaluate the derivative $\\frac{\\partial k_{t+1}}{\\partial k_t}$ at the steady state:\n$$\\frac{\\partial k_{t+1}}{\\partial k_t} = \\frac{s^\\prime_{\\omega}\\left(w^\\prime (k_t)-b\\frac{\\overbrace{r^\\prime (k_t)}^{\u0026lt;0}}{1+n}\\right)}{1+n-s^\\prime_{R}R^\\prime (k_{t+1})}.$$\nAt the steady state we have that:\n$$\\frac{\\partial k_{t+1}}{\\partial k_t}\\Bigg|_{k_t=k_{t+1}=\\bar{k}} = \\frac{s^\\prime_{\\omega}\\left(w^\\prime (\\bar{k})-b\\frac{\\overbrace{r^\\prime (\\bar{k})}^{\u0026lt;0}}{1+n}\\right)}{1+n-s^\\prime_{R}R^\\prime (\\bar{k})}.$$\nWe then have that the steady state is stable if $\\frac{\\partial k_{t+1}}{\\partial k_t}\\Bigg|_{k_t = k_{t+1} = \\bar{k}} \\in (-1,1).$ Therefore, the steady state is stable if and only if:\n$$\\frac{s^\\prime_{\\omega}\\left(w^\\prime (\\bar{k})-b\\frac{\\overbrace{r^\\prime (\\bar{k})}^{\u0026lt;0}}{1+n}\\right)}{1+n-s^\\prime_{R}R^\\prime (\\bar{k})} \u0026lt; 1 \\implies s^\\prime_\\omega \\omega^\\prime(\\bar{k})-b\\frac{r^\\prime(\\bar{k})}{1+n} \u0026lt; 1+n-s^\\prime_R R^\\prime(\\bar{k}).$$\nWe shall assume that the steady state is stable. Hence, we assume that:\n$$s^\\prime_\\omega \\omega^\\prime(\\bar{k})-b\\frac{r^\\prime(\\bar{k})}{1+n} \u0026lt; 1+n-s^\\prime_R R^\\prime(\\bar{k}).$$\nThe effects of fiscal policy on $\\bar{k}$ We can now study how the fiscal policy variables $b$ and $g$ affect the steady-state level of capital.\n$$\\bar{k}=\\frac{1}{1+n}s\\left(w(\\bar{k})-b\\frac{r(\\bar{k})-n-\\delta}{1+n}-g, R(\\bar{k})\\right)-\\frac{b}{1+n}.$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\bar{k}}{\\partial b} = - \\frac{s^\\prime_{\\omega}\\left(\\frac{r(\\bar{k}) -n - \\delta}{1+n}\\right)+1}{\\underbrace{1+n-s^\\prime_\\omega \\left(\\omega^\\prime(\\bar{k})-b\\frac{r^\\prime(\\bar{k})}{1+n}\\right)-s^\\prime_R R^\\prime(\\bar{k})}_{\u0026gt;0, \\mathrm{because, of, stability}}}. $$\nUsing the fact that $R(k) = 1 + r(k) - \\delta$ we can rewrite the numerator as:\n$$s^\\prime_{\\omega}\\left(\\frac{r(\\bar{k}) -n - \\delta}{1+n}\\right)+1=s^\\prime_\\omega \\left(\\frac{R(\\bar{k})-1-n}{1+n}\\right)+1 = 1 - \\underbrace{s^{\\prime}_\\omega}_{\\in (0,1)} + \\underbrace{s^\\prime_\\omega}_{\u0026gt;0} \\frac{R(\\bar{k})}{1+n} \u0026gt; 0.$$\nWe showed that $s^\\prime_{\\omega} \\in (0,1)$ when we discussed the savings function.\nThen, we have that\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\bar{k}}{\\partial b} = - \\frac{s^\\prime_{\\omega}\\left(\\overbrace{1-s^\\prime_\\omega+s^\\prime_\\omega\\frac{R(\\bar{k})}{1+n}}^{\u0026gt;0}\\right)}{\\underbrace{1+n-s^\\prime_\\omega \\left(\\omega^\\prime(\\bar{k})-b\\frac{r^\\prime(\\bar{k})}{1+n}\\right)-s^\\prime_R R^\\prime(\\bar{k})}_{\u0026gt;0, \\mathrm{because, of, stability}}}\u0026lt; 0 .$$\nWe proceed similarly with $g$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\bar{k}}{\\partial g}= - \\frac{s^\\prime_\\omega}{\\underbrace{1+n-s^\\prime_\\omega \\left(\\omega^\\prime(\\bar{k})-b\\frac{r^\\prime(\\bar{k})}{1+n}\\right)-s^\\prime_R R^\\prime(\\bar{k})}_{\u0026gt;0, \\mathrm{because, of, stability}}}\u0026lt; 0 .$$\nTherefore, as long as the steady state is stable, increasing the fiscal policies decreases the long-run value of $\\bar{k}.$ In other terms, higher expenditures or debt reduce capital. Thus, the fiscal policy makes over-accumulation less likely if the steady state is stable. The role of debt is intuitive: government bonds are perfect substitutes with capital, hence households holding them invest less in capital. Similarly, higher expenditures must be financed either with debt or taxes. The latter reduces available income, which reduces savings, impacting capital accumulation.\nExample To illustrate the findings so far we proceed with an example. As usual, we take a log-utility function and a Cobb-Douglas production function. Note: this choice of utility already implies that $s^\\prime_R = 0.$\nFurthermore, we assume that $\\delta = 1:$ capital fully depreciates in one period. Since here one period corresponds to roughly 30 years, this may be a good approximation.\n$$f(k) = k^\\alpha, \\alpha \\in (0,1)$$ $$u(c,d) = \\log ( c ) + \\beta \\log(d), \\beta \\in (0,1).$$\nThe budget constraint is:\n$$w_t = c_t + s_t + \\tau_ t$$ $$d_{t+1} = R_{t+1} s_t.$$\nWe can readily see that the savings function satisfies:\n$$u^\\prime(w_t - \\tau_t - s_t) = R_{t+1}\\beta u^\\prime (R_{t+1} s) \\implies s_t = \\frac{\\beta}{1+\\beta}(w_t - \\tau_t).$$\nWith the technology we are given we also know that:\n$$R_t = \\alpha k_t^{\\alpha-1},\\quad w_t = (1-\\alpha)k_t^\\alpha.$$\nThe law of motion of capital follows:\n$$k_{t+1} = \\frac{1}{1+n}s\\left(w_t - \\tau_t \\right) = \\frac{1}{1+n}\\frac{\\beta}{1+\\beta}(w_t - \\tau_t) - \\frac{b}{1+n}.$$\nWe can already substitute into it the equilibrium values for the interest rate and the government\u0026rsquo;s budget constraint:\n$$\\tau_t = g + \\frac{R_t - 1 -n}{1+n}.$$\nHence\n$$k_{t+1} = \\frac{\\beta}{(1+n)(1+\\beta)}\\left((1-\\alpha)k_t^\\alpha - b \\frac{\\alpha k_t^{\\alpha -1} -1 -n}{1+n}-g\\right)-\\frac{b}{1+n} = \\xi \\left((1-\\alpha)k_t^\\alpha - b \\frac{\\alpha k_t^{\\alpha -1}}{1+n}-g\\right)-\\frac{b}{1+n}+\\xi b = \\phi(b,g,k_t),$$ where $\\xi \\equiv \\frac{\\beta}{(1+n)(1+\\beta)}.$\nStability Instead of computing the value of capital at the steady state (which we cannot do), we study the function $\\phi(b,g,k_t).$\nFirst, notice that changing $b$ or $g$ displaces $\\phi$ downwards, but the displacement is not parallel. $$\\phi^\\prime_b = - \\frac{\\beta}{(1+n)(1+\\beta)}\\frac{\\alpha k^{\\alpha-1}}{1+n} - \\frac{1}{1+n} + \\xi \u0026lt; 0$$ $$\\phi^\\prime_g = -\\frac{\\beta}{(1+n)(1+\\beta)} \u0026lt; 0.$$\nHowever, increasing $g$ always reduces $k_{t+1}$ by the same amount: $g$ moves the curve vertically. $$\\phi^{\\prime \\prime}_{g,k} = 0.$$ Instead, raising $b$ has a different effect depending on the value of $k.$ In particular, the gap widens and reaches a constant difference: $$\\phi^{\\prime \\prime}_{b,k} = \\frac{k^{\\alpha-2}(1-\\alpha)\\alpha\\beta}{(1+n)^2(1+\\beta)} \u0026gt; 0$$ and $$\\lim_{k \\rightarrow +\\infty}\\phi^{\\prime \\prime}_{b,k} = 0.$$\nThe function $\\phi$ is increasing and concave in $k$:\n$$\\phi^\\prime_k = \\xi \\left((1-\\alpha)k^{\\alpha-1}-\\frac{b \\alpha (\\alpha-1)}{1+n}k^{\\alpha-2}\\right) \u0026gt; 0.$$ $$\\phi^{\\prime \\prime}_{k,k} = \\xi \\left((1-\\alpha)(\\alpha-1)k^{\\alpha-2}-\\frac{b \\alpha(\\alpha-1)(\\alpha-2)}{1+n}k^{\\alpha-3}\\right) \u0026lt; 0.$$\nFinally, we have the following limits:\n$$\\lim_{k \\rightarrow 0}\\phi = 0 , \\mathrm{if} , b=0$$ $$\\lim_{k \\rightarrow 0}\\phi = -\\infty , \\mathrm{if} b\u0026gt;0.$$ $$\\lim_{k \\rightarrow +\\infty}\\phi = +\\infty.$$\nWhen $b=g=0$ we are back to the initial case without government. The Cobb-Douglas and log-utility specifications are characterised by two steady states:\n $\\bar{k} \u0026gt; 0$, which is stable, $\\bar{k}=0$, which is unstable.  With $b,g\u0026gt;0$ the $k_{t+1}$ curve moves downwards and the economy displays two steady states:\n $\\bar{k}$, which is unstable, $\\overline{k}$, which is stable.  There are two additional possibilities: in the first one, the $k_{t+1}$ curve is tangent to the 45 degree line. In that (unlikely) case, a unique steady state arises, but it is non-hyperbolic and we cannot infer its stability from the linearised version. Note: we know that the steady state is non-hyperbolic because $k_{t+1}$ evaluated at the steady state is tangent to a 45 degree line.\nIn the second case, if $b$ or $g$ are big enough, the economy has no steady state.\n  We have implicitly assumed it when we stated that bonds payed the same interest rate as capital. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1562803200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562803200,"objectID":"c278b8e43dcce10474d4862a337da7e2","permalink":"https://eric-roca.github.io/courses/olg/government/","publishdate":"2019-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/olg/government/","section":"courses","summary":"Based on de la Croix and Michel, Chapter 4.4\nThe Ricardian equivalence The Ricardian equivalence states that forward-looking agents internalise the government\u0026rsquo;s budget constraint when deciding.

However, what we claimed was that the entire path was optimal. We can prove it by solving the Ramsey allocation problem from the perspective of the social planner.\nSocial planner A social planner maximises total welfare, given by:\n$$\\max \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\beta^{t} u(c_{t}).$$\nThe social planner directly allocates resources between consumption and investment, so he is not bothered by wages or interest rates. In particular, he has to allocate total production and capital net of depreciation between $c_{t}$ and $k_{t+1}.$ Hence his intertemporal budget constraint reads:\n$$f(k_{t}) = c_{t} + k_{t+1} + (1-\\delta) k_{t}.$$ The planner operates under a certain level $k_{0} \u0026gt; 0$ given.\nThe budget constraint is equivalent to the one we found in the competitive equilibrium. Moreover, total welfare coincides, with household\u0026rsquo;s utility. Hence, the solutions will be the same, proving that the competitive equilibrium was optimal.\nThe two main equations of the model are relevant for the planner as well. First, he must follow the Euler equation. In fact, he can reduce present consumption by $\\Delta c$ at time $t$ and save it. The present-day cost is $u^{\\prime} ( c_{t} ) \\Delta_{c}$. He obtains $f^{\\prime}(k_t) \\Delta_{c} + (1-\\delta) \\Delta_{c}$ at time $t+1,$ which raises utility by $\\left( f^{\\prime}(k_{t}) \\Delta_{c} + (1-\\delta) \\Delta_{c} \\right) u^{\\prime}_{c_{t+1}}.$ Optimality implies that this trade off is not possible anymore, hence, we obtain the Euler equation again.\nSecond, although the planner directly allocates consumption and investments, he must follow the technological constraint displayed above. This does not represent preferences, and coincides with the household\u0026rsquo;s budget constraint after clearing the markets.\nFinally, observe that the first welfare theorem directly applies: if markets are competitive and there are no externalities, then the decentralised equilibrium is Pareto-efficient. All conditions hold in the Ramsey model.\nThe Golden rule We have discussed before that, in the Ramsey model, the economy converges to a steady state with $\\bar{k}$ below the Golden-rule level of capital $k^{\\mathcal{GR}}$.\nThis contrasts with the Solow model: in the Solow model, a sufficiently high saving rate causes capital over-accumulation. This opens the possibility of finding alternative paths that yield higher consumption levels in each and every period \u0026mdash;meaning that such a saving rate was not Pareto-efficient.\nIn the Ramsey model, savings are optimally derived from utility maximisation, and the level of utility depends on consumption. Moreover, the model features no externalities. Consequently, the model cannot produce a situation whereby it is possible to increase consumption at each and every period: this would contradict optimisation.\nHowever, $\\bar{k} \u0026lt; k^{\\mathcal{GR}}$ implies that it is possible to increase the saving rate today, build up the extra capital needed to reach $k^{\\mathcal{GR}}$ and then be able to consume $c^{\\mathcal{GR}} \u0026gt; \\bar{c}$ at the steady state \u0026mdash;which, remember, lasts forever. Suppose that we had reached the steady-state. Why do the households not change their saving rate to reach $c^{\\mathcal{GR}}?$ The reason is that households value present consumption more than future consumption. Therefore, the current utility cost of a reduction in consumption is larger the future gains once discounted. Because of the discount rate, the utility gains from an eventual permanent increase in consumption are bounded.\nAll in all, the economy converges to a value $\\bar{k}$ below the steady state. Because $\\bar{k}$ is the optimal level of $k$ for the economy to converge to, it is known as the modified Golden-rule capital stock.\nWe had already noticed that the discount factor $\\beta$ prevents the economy from reaching the Golden-rule level of capital. According to our computation, the Golden-rule level of capital is only attained if $\\beta = 1.$ This implies that present and future consumption are valued the same, which complements the discussion above.\n","date":1562803200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562803200,"objectID":"ada6fa75964a136d429111ac4e6a5f73","permalink":"https://eric-roca.github.io/courses/ramsey/ramsey_remarks/","publishdate":"2019-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/ramsey/ramsey_remarks/","section":"courses","summary":"Optimality Before we claimed that the solution is optimal despite the fact that it does not maximise consumption at the steady state.

It proposes and empirically assesses a new class of determinants of gender equality: increases in women's bargaining power through reductions in the cost of remaining single. In particular, enlarging women's options besides marriage \u0026mdash;even if only temporarily\u0026mdash; increases their bargaining power with respect to men, leading to a persistent improvement in gender equality. We illustrate this mechanism focusing on the specific Belgian context, and relate gender-equality levels in the 19th century to the presence of medieval, female-only communities called _beguinages_ that allowed women to remain single amidst a society that advocated the opposite. Combining precise beguinages' location with 19th-century census data, we document that beguinages were instrumental in decreasing the gender gap in literacy.","tags":["Gender Equality","Economic History","Empirical Work"],"title":"Roots of Gender Equality: the Persistent Effect of Beguinages on Attitudes Toward Women","type":"working_papers"},{"authors":["Èric Roca Fernández"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1488463200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488463200,"objectID":"fa52df73c3dced26870a3b85f2f06819","permalink":"https://eric-roca.github.io/talk/2017-02_providence_2/","publishdate":"2017-02-02T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2017-02_providence_2/","section":"talk","summary":"We analyse how inheritance rules affect rulers' willingness to invest in state capacity.
