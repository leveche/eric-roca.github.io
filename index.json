Suffit de lire le titre du plus célèbre ouvrage d’Adam Smith: “Recherches sur la nature et les causes de la richesse des nations”. Dès nos jours, l’écart entre pays est assez large : la différence de PIB per capita entre le pays le plus développé (Hong-Kong, États-Unis) et le moins développé (Burundi) montre un ratio de 127:1. Même dans un seul continent, on voit différences assez larges : Trinité-et-Tobago a un PIB per capita 31 fois plus grand qu’Haïti; Macao 170 plus qu’Afghanistan; Monaco 51 fois plus qu’Ukraine.\nPour améliorer notre compréhension sur ce sujet, différents modèles illustrent certains aspects liés à la croissance économique et ses causes. Ainsi, on propose comme raisons de croissance économique les suivantes :\nAccumulation des facteurs de production : Capital physique (Solow, 1956 ; Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans, 1928,1965,1965) Capital humain (Lucas, 1988) Le progrès technologique : Croissance endogène (Romer, 1990 ; Agion-Howitt, 1992) Les théories précédentes se basent sur deux hypothèses classiques en économie :\nRendements décroissants en l’accumulation de capital physique et humain, Une réduction de l’effet du progrès technologique sur la productivité. Pour tant, ces théories prédissent une réduction des inégalités, c’est-à-dire, de la convergence vers un même niveau de revenu per capita. Par contre, ceci n’est pas observé dans les données, plutôt au contraire. La Figure suivante indique que les pays les plus pauvres n’ont pas crû plus rapidement que les pays les plus développés. Si c’était le cas, on verrait les pays les plus pauvres vers 1980 groupés au-dessus de la ligne de 45 dégrée. Par contre, on constate qu’ils sont plutôt en dessous. Théories néoclassiques et croissance Les théories néoclassiques (se focalisant surtout sur l’accumulation de capital et la croissance endogène) ont achevée du succès pour expliquer le processus de croissance économique pendant la période moderne. Ainsi, en partant des hypothèses de base, elles montrent comment le capital (physique et humain) s’accumule et cela contribue à générer une croissance économique.\nManque de convergence Plus en détail, ce qui est important, c’est l’accumulation du capital per capita, c’est-à-dire, que même si une économie voit sa population augmenter, le capital augmente à une vitesse supérieure. Or, dû aux rendements décroissants, la croissance du capital per capita devient de moins au moins vite, jusqu’à finir pour ne plus croitre et donc, elle devient une constante.1 Ainsi, beaucoup de théories de croissance économique prédissent que tous les pays vont arriver à cette situation stationnaire. Ainsi, selon cette idée, les précurseurs de l’industrialisation devront montrer une croissance plus faible à mesure qu’ils atteignent leur état stationnaire. Et, au contraire, les pays qui ont débouté leur processus d’industrialisation plus tard, devront montrer un taux de croissance plus important. Hélas, les données ne confirment pas ce point : si c’était le cas, la droite de régression devrait avoir une pente décroissante, c’est-à-dire, les pays qu’étaient les plus riches dans le passé devront montrer un taux de croissance plus faible.\nNote: Le type de convergence pour laquelle on compare le taux de croissance et le niveau initial du revenu per capita s’appelle “bêta convergence”. Lien technologie et revenu en époque Malthusienne Une deuxième limitation des théories néoclassiques est leur point sur le processus de croissance moderne. Alors, ces théories ignorent presque la totalité de l’existence des Homo sapiens sur terre. En effet, toutes les théories néoclassiques essaient de présenter des éléments de croissances qui ont été importants pendant les derniers siècles, plus ou moins depuis la révolution industrielle. Par contre, les Homo sapiens existent depuis plus de 100 000 années et la plupart de leur existence est complètement ignoré. Ce qui est encore plus important, l’existence des hommes est caractérisé par un mode de vie qu’on connaît avec le nom d’époque Malthusienne.\nEncore plus important, l’époque Malthusienne, qui comprend plus du 99% du temps d’existence de l’homme, a comme caractéristique que, chaque fois que la technologie améliorait, cela se traduisait par une augmentation de la population, mais sans avoir un effet sur le revenu per capita.2 Ainsi, durant cette période, une meilleure technologie se traduisait par plus de population et non par plus de revenu per capita. Or, les théories néoclassiques impliquent, directement, qu’une amélioration de la technologie est liée à une augmentation du revenu per capita (dans le court comme dans le long terme). Ainsi, cette opposition entre modèle et réalité montre que les modèles néoclassiques sont incapables d’expliquer la totalité du processus de croissance économique.3 Cela reste important car, comme on verra lors …","date":1562803200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1562803200,"objectID":"03b2e13c6edb24f79ab0225c4e049055","permalink":"https://example.com/courses/macroeconomics/comparative_development/","publishdate":"2019-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/macroeconomics/comparative_development/","section":"courses","summary":"Développement comparé","tags":null,"title":"Développement comparé","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Introduction These lectures continue the course of International Trade, presented by professor Émilie Caldeira.

One of the main features of this model is that agents have an infinite horizon: they live forever and optimise considering an infinite horizon.\nThe overlapping generations model changes this hypothesis and focuses on the life-cycle: agents make decisions regarding how to consume, and how much to save for retirement. This is, the OLG model assumes that agents work until some age, and then retire.1 A focus of the OLG model is the intergenerational redistribution, allowing to study:\nsocial security, education policies and public debt. The main departure with respect to the Ramsey model is that in OLG, agents are heterogeneous. Individuals live for two periods of time, and then die. In the first period, they are young and work. When old, they retire and live from savings. Hence, at any point in time, two types of agents with different budget constraints exist: young and adults.2\nAs we shall see, in this model the competitive path may not be optimal. Consequently, there may be instances in which the utility of all individuals can be increased. Therefore, the OLG model opens the door to government intervention, to reallocate consumption and savings efficiently. The OLG framework also permits the existence of bubbles and fluctuations.\nA basic reference for this model is Diamond, (1965).\nThe Ramsey model can be seen as an extension to the OLG model when agents are altruistic enough. ↩︎\nOther set-ups are possible within the LG framework.

To see this, take its typical form:\n$$f(x,y) = x^\\alpha y^{1-\\alpha}$$\nand verify that $f(\\lambda x, \\lambda y) = \\lambda f(x,y).$ Indeed, $f(\\lambda x, \\lambda y) = (\\lambda x)^{\\alpha} (\\lambda y)^{1-\\alpha} = \\lambda x^{\\alpha} y^{1-\\alpha} = \\lambda f(x,y).$\nExample: A CES production function\nA CES production function takes the form $f(x,y) = \\left(\\alpha x^{\\eta} + (1-\\alpha) y ^{\\eta}\\right)^{\\frac{\\zeta}{\\eta}},, \\eta \\leq 1.$ This type of function is homogeneous of degree $\\zeta:$\n$$f(\\lambda x, \\lambda y) = \\left(\\alpha \\lambda^{\\eta} x^{\\eta} + (1-\\alpha) \\lambda^{\\eta} y^{\\eta}\\right)^{\\frac{\\zeta}{\\eta}} = \\lambda^{\\zeta} f(x,y).$$\nProperties of the derivatives of homogeneous functions Assume that $f$ is continuously differentiable of as many degrees as required.\nThe derivative of a function homogeneous of degree $p$ is homogeneous of degree $p-1$.\nIf a function $f$ is of degree $p$, then for any $n = 1, \\ldots, N$ the partial derivative $\\partial f(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{N})/\\partial x_{n}$ is of degree $p-1.$\nNote: see proof in Mas-Colell et al.\nExamples:\nA Cobb-Douglas production function $f(x,y) = x^{\\alpha} y^{1-\\alpha}$ has derivates equal to $f_{x}(x,y) = \\alpha x^{\\alpha-1} y^{1-\\alpha}$ and $f_{y}(x,y) = (1-\\alpha) x^{\\alpha} y^{-\\alpha}.$ Then it is easy to check that $$f_{x}(\\lambda x, \\lambda y) = \\lambda^{0} f_{x}(x,y)$$ and $$f_{y}(\\lambda x, \\lambda y) = \\lambda^{0} f_{y}(x,y),$$ which implies that derivatives are homogeneous of degree zero.\nThe CES function $f$: $f(x,y) = (\\alpha x^{\\eta} + (1-\\alpha) y^{\\eta})^{\\frac{\\zeta}{\\eta}}$ is homogeneous of degree $\\zeta$. The derivative function $f_{x}(x,y) = \\alpha \\zeta x^{\\eta - 1} (\\alpha x^{\\eta} + (1-\\alpha)y^{\\eta})^{\\frac{\\zeta-\\eta}{\\eta}}$ is homogeneous of degree $\\zeta-1$: $$f_{x}(\\lambda x, \\lambda y) = \\alpha \\zeta x^{\\eta - 1}\\lambda^{\\eta-1}(\\alpha \\lambda^{\\eta} x^{\\eta} + (1-\\alpha) \\lambda^{\\eta} y^{\\eta})^{\\frac{\\zeta-\\eta}{\\eta}} = \\lambda^{\\zeta-1} \\alpha \\zeta x^{\\eta - 1}(\\alpha x^{\\eta} + (1-\\alpha) y^{\\eta})^{\\frac{\\zeta-\\eta}{\\eta}} = \\lambda^{\\zeta-1} f_{x}(x,y).$$ We can proceed similarly for $y$.\nEuler’s formula This is an interesting property of homogeneous functions. In particular, it is useful in showing that, if the production function is homogeneous of degree one and factors are paid their marginal product, then profits are zero.\nSuppose that $f(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{N})$ is homogeneous of degree $p$ and differentiable. So, at any set of values $(\\bar{x_{1}}, \\ldots, \\bar{x_{N}})$ we have:\n$$\\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\frac{\\partial f(\\bar{x_{1}}, \\ldots, \\bar{x_{N}})}{\\partial x_{n}} \\bar{x_{n}} = p f(\\bar{x_{1}}, \\ldots, x_{N}).$$\nIn words, if we multiply the derivatives by the variable with respect which we derivate and add all of them up, we retrieve the original function $p$ times. Setting $p=1$ delivers the property we announced before.\nExample\nIf the production function is homogeneous of degree one, under perfect competition (factors are paid their marginal product) firms make zero profits: For simplicity, take a Cobb-Douglas function $$f(x,y)=x^{\\alpha} y^{1-\\alpha}.$$ Marginal products are $$f_{x} = \\alpha x^{\\alpha -1}y^{1-\\alpha}$$ and $$f_{y} = (1-\\alpha) x^{\\alpha} y^{-\\alpha}.$$ Applying Euler’s formula we get: $$f_{x} x + f_{y} y = \\alpha x^{\\alpha - 1} y^{1-\\alpha} x + (1-\\alpha) x^{\\alpha} y^{-\\alpha} y = f(x,y).$$ Hence, the total amount produced ($f(x,y)$) is distributed to factor owners, and the firm necessarily makes zero profits. Applications to work with intensive-form functions Often, we express the production function $F(K,L)$ in intensive terms. This is, instead of focusing on the level of capital and labour, we are interested in the level of capital per worker. In other terms, we focus on $k \\equiv \\frac{K}{L}.$ Since we assume a production function of degree one, the transformation is simple. Remember that if we multiply both factors by the same number, the result is also multiplied by that same number. Hence, if we pick $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{L}$ we obtain:\n$$f(k) \\equiv F\\left(\\frac{K}{L}, \\frac{L}{L} \\right) = \\frac{1}{L} F\\left( K,L \\right).$$ Therefore, rearranging: $$F(K,L) = Lf(k).$$ …","date":1562803200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562803200,"objectID":"a0c3b1717f953a53842b1af4b77b766f","permalink":"https://example.com/courses/macroeconomics/math_app/homogenous_functions/","publishdate":"2019-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/macroeconomics/math_app/homogenous_functions/","section":"courses","summary":"Notes based on Appendix A.1.1 of de la Croix and Michel: A Theory of Economic Growth. and Appendix M.B of Mas-Colell, Whinston and Green: Microeconomic Theory.\nHomogeneity A function of N variables $f(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{N})$ defined for all non-negative values $(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{N})$ is homogeneous of degree $p$ if:","tags":null,"title":"Homogenous functions","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The economy is populated by a large number of identical households.

For simplicity, savings take the form of capital (instead of assets). Households lend capital to firms, obtaining a real interest $r_t$. However, capital is subject to a constant depreciation rate $\\delta$.\nTherefore, at each period of time, households face the following budget constraint:\n$$c_{t} + k_{t+1} = w_{t} + r_{t} k_{t} + (1-\\delta) k_{t}. \\tag{2, Budget C.}$$\nThe left-hand side represents expenditures during the period $t$:\nConsumption Saving The right-hand side includes all sources of income:\nWages Interests Remaining capital after depreciation Effectively, households can eat capital Note: The budget constraint could have included dividends $d_{t}$ on the right-hand side. However, as we shall see, firms operate in perfect competition, and make zero profits.\nSolving the household’s problem First, we assume that households have perfect foresight. This means that a household is able to perfectly forecast all the future values of the relevant variables when deciding. For instance, at time $t$ the household is able to correctly compute $r_{t+1}$ and $w_{t+1}.$\nAssumption R2: Households have perfect foresight.\nWe are interested in finding the optimal consumption and savings path, this is, the one that yields maximum utility. Note that the problem is infinite, in the sense that we need to determine $c_{t}$ and $k_{t+1}$ for each and every period of time. From the perspective of a household, the intertemporal maximisation problem reads:\n$$\\begin{eqnarray} \u0026amp;\\max_{c_{t}, k_{t+1}} \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\beta^{t} u(c_{t}) \\\\\\ \u0026amp; c_{t} + k_{t+1} = w_{t} + r_{t} k_{t} + (1- \\delta) k_{t} \\forall t\\geq0. \\end{eqnarray}$$\nFirst, we write the Langrangian equation corresponding to the problem:\n$$\\mathcal{L} = \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\beta^t u(c_{t}) + \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\lambda_{t}(w_{t} + r_{t}k_{t} + (1-\\delta)k_{t} - c_{t} - k_{t+1}).$$\nNote: this Lagrangian has infinite multipliers $\\lambda_{t},$ one for each period.\nAt time $t$, households have two decisions to make:\nHow much to consume at $t$: $c_{t}$ How much to save at $t$: $k_{t+1}$ Therefore, we derive the Lagrangian function with respect to $c_{t}$ and $k_{t+1}$.\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial c_{t}} = \\beta^{t} u^{\\prime}(c_{t}) - \\lambda_{t}$$ $$\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial k_{t+1}} = - \\lambda_{t} + \\lambda_{t+1}(r_{t+1}+(1-\\delta))$$\nSetting both expressions equal to zero to obtain the maximum and combining them yields:\n$$u^{\\prime}(c_{t}) = \\beta u^{\\prime}(c_{t+1})(r_{t+1}+1-\\delta). \\tag{3, Euler Eq.}$$\nThis condition is called the Euler equation. It tells us the optimal behaviour of the household. Rearranging the expression a little bit, we are left with a clearer expression linking present and future consumption:\n$$\\frac{u^{\\prime}(c_{t})}{u^{\\prime}(c_{t+1})} = \\beta (r_{t+1} + 1 - \\delta). \\tag{3.1, Euler eq.}$$\nSlightly more complex relationships can arise if the population grows or there is technological progress, see Romer, Chapter 2.\nThe Euler equation The Euler equation often appears in optimisation problems: either using discrete or continuous time. The discrete-time version is relatively easier to interpret and obtain. In our case, the Euler equation relates the present and future marginal utilities of consumption. Imagine that the household decreased the amount consumed today, $c_{t}$ by an infinitesimally small amount $\\Delta_{c_{t}}$. This causes a utility loss of $\\Delta_{c_{t}} u^{\\prime}(c_{t})$. Saving $\\Delta_{c_{t}}$ until tomorrow and consuming all the proceedings generates a utility gain of $\\Delta_{c_{t}}(r_{t+1} + 1 - \\delta) u^{\\prime}(c_{t+1})$. This gain must be, of course, discounted using the rate $\\beta$ to compare present-day equivalents.\nSince the household is optimising, both the loss and the gain must be equal, otherwise, there would be an alternative consumption level that would maximise utility.

In particular, the Ricardian model emphasizes differences in comparative advantages that can be ultimately related to different production functions. The Heckscher-Ohlin model places the emphasis on the relative abundance of production factors.1 However, when dealing with real-world applications, these models may be too restrictive. In fact, it is quite likely that the reasons behind trade include, up to some point, all the elements that these different models highlight.\nIn any case, the two (three) models have some common elements, which make the building blocks of the Standard Trade Model.\nThe productive capacity of an economy is determined by its production possibility frontier. Differences in this frontier give rise to trade. Production possibilities (and demand) determine a country’s relative supply schedule. World equilibrium is determined by world relative demand and world relative supply. The Standard Model of Trade is built of four key relationships:\nThe relationship between the production possibility frontier and the relative supply curve, The relationship between relative prices and relative demand, The determination of world equilibrium by world relative supply and world relative demand, and The effects of the terms of trade (price of a country’s exports divided by the price of its imports) on a nation’s welfare. Production possibility frontier and the relative supply curve We present a situation very similar to that of the Heckscher-Ohlin model. Suppose there are only two countries in the world, Home (H) and Foreign (F), and that two products are produced in each country, Food (F) and Clothing (C). Of course, each sector is equipped with a unique technology, and in principle, technologies can be different in different countries. Underlying these production functions, we have production factors. For instance, in the Heckscher-Ohlin model we had two production factors: Capital (K) and Labour (L).\nDrawing the production possibility frontier (PPF) The possibility frontier is a function that relates the quantities produced in each sector when the production processes use the same finite resources. This is, in our case, the PPF indicates how many units of Food the economy can produce considering that it is currently producing $C$ units of clothing. Of course, we assume that production is efficient, this is, the production factors $K$ and $L$ are allocated efficiently between sectors. Note: an implicit assumption is that the economy makes use of all resources.\nConsider the following production functions: $$Q_F = H(K_F, L_F), \\mathrm{and}, Q_C = G(K_C,L_C).$$ Since the economy uses all the available resources, we also have that $$K = K_F + K_C, \\mathrm{and}, L = L_F + L_C.$$\nThis process is a bit convoluted if we use generic functions. However, we first describe the general process and then go through the details using an example. The general objective is to find the maximum amount of good $F$ that the economy can produce considering that it is already producing $C$ units of clothing. Moreover, we shall assume that production of $C$ is efficient. If we then vary the amount of $C$, we can retrieve the PPF. Hence, we are really solving the following constrained maximisation problem for a given level $C = \\bar{C}.$\n$$\\begin{align} \\max_{K_F,L_F} \u0026amp; \\, H(K_F, L_F) \\\\\\ \\mathrm{s.t.} \u0026amp; \\, G(K_C, L_C) = \\bar{C},\\\\\\ \u0026amp;K=K_F + K_C, \\\\\\ \u0026amp;L = L_F + L_C. \\end{align}$$\nIf we solve for the associated Lagrangian, we obtain the condition:\n$$\\frac{H_{K_F}}{H_{L_F}} = \\frac{G_{K_C}}{G_{L_C}}.$$ And since $K=K_F + K_C$ and $L = L_F + L_C$ $$\\frac{H_{K-K_C}}{H_{L-L_C}} = \\frac{G_{K_C}}{G_{L_C}}.$$\nThe previous expression defines a relationship between capital used in the production of clothes $K_C$ and labour used in the production of clothes $L_C.$ For suitable cases, it is possible to isolate one of the two and obtain a closed-form solution $L_C = Z(K_C),$ where $Z(\\cdot)$ is a function. Lastly, we can write a parametric function for clothing and food production: $$(Q_C\\,,Q_F) = (G(K_C, Z(K_C)),\\, H(K-K_C, L-Z(K_C))).$$ Finally, in some particular cases we can transform the parametric equation into an explicit relationship between $C$ and $F$.\nExample: Suppose that $H(K_F, L_F) = K_F^{\\frac{1}{3}}L_F^{\\frac{2}{3}}$ and $G(K_C,L_C) = K_C^{\\frac{1}{2}} L_C^{\\frac{1}{2}}.$ Since both sectors optimize, we have that $MRS$ across sectors coincide, this is, $\\frac{H_{K_F}}{H_{L_F}} = \\frac{G_{K_C}}{G_{L_C}}.$ In our case, we have:\n$$\\frac{\\frac{1}{3}K_F^{-\\frac{2}{3}}L_F^{\\frac{2}{3}}}{\\frac{2}{3}K_F^{\\frac{1}{3}}L_F^{-\\frac{1}{3}}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}K_C^{-\\frac{1}{2}}L_C^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{\\frac{1}{2}K_C^{\\frac{1}{2}}L_C^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}.$$ Or, after some simplifications, $$\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{L_F}{K_F} = \\frac{L_C}{K_C} \\implies 2 L_C K_F = L_F K_C.$$ Since $K=K_F + K_C$ and $L = L_F + L_C$, we …","date":1562803200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562803200,"objectID":"3642197d758ec8c8535134603ee83d92","permalink":"https://example.com/courses/international_trade/standard_trade_model/","publishdate":"2019-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/international_trade/standard_trade_model/","section":"courses","summary":"The Standard Trade Model","tags":null,"title":"The Standard Trade Model","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This note is based on Appendix A.3.2 of de la Croix and Michel: A Theory of Economic Growth.\nMacroeconomic models often have dynamic equations relating different periods of time. These can either be in continuous or discrete time. In this note, we focus only on the discrete-time case, but the intuition carries over to the continuous case. When equations are in discrete time, we call time difference equations. The continuous-time equivalents are called differential equations. Note: the conditions for stability change between the continuous and discrete-time cases.\nA dynamic equation: one-dimensional case A dynamic equation is an equation that relates the state of a variable through time to the value the variable took in previous periods. The number of lags the equation considers determines its order. A difference equation of order $T$ takes the form $$x_{t+1} = f(x_{t}, x_{t-1}, \\ldots, x_{t-T}).$$\nFirst-order difference equation One of the most common cases that arises in macroeconomic models is the first-order difference equation. It relates the present value of a variable to the value it took in the period immediately before:\n$$x_{t+1} = f(x_{t}).$$\nWe are often interested in the steady state of difference equations. The steady state is defined as the set of values $\\bar{x}$ (there can be more than one steady state) such that, if reached, the economy remains there. Equivalently, once reached, the value of the variable $x$ remains unchanged. Mathematically, $\\bar{x}$ is a steady state of a first-order difference equation if\n$$\\bar{x} = f(\\bar{x}).$$\nProving that a steady state $\\bar{x}$ exists may involve using different techniques.\nExample: Assume the following first-order difference equation:\n$$x_{t+1} = x_{t}^{\\eta} +\\kappa, \\kappa\u0026gt;0, \\eta \\in (0,1).$$\nThe steady state solves: $\\bar{x} = \\bar{x}^{\\eta}+\\kappa$.\nTo show that it exists we can prove that the function $F(\\bar{x}) = \\bar{x} - \\bar{x}^{\\eta} - \\kappa$ as at least one root. Note that $F(0) = -\\kappa \u0026lt;0$ and that $\\lim_{\\bar{x} \\rightarrow +\\infty} F(\\bar{x}) = + \\infty.$ Hence, since it is a continuous function, it must have at least one solution. We can further show that it admits one and only one solution by proving that $x_{t+1}$ is a monotonous function of $x_{t}$. Monotonicity is the key here, not whether it increases or decreases, although in our case it is increasing.\n$$\\frac{\\partial x_{t+1}}{\\partial x_{t}} = \\eta x_{t}^{\\eta-1} \u0026gt; 0.$$\nHence, the function is monotonous (always increasing) and there is one and only one root.\nStability of a first-order difference equation A steady state solution $\\bar{x}$ to $\\bar{x} = f(\\bar{x})$ which is interior to the domain of $f$ is locally stable if for any initial value $x_{0}$ near enough to $\\bar{x}$, the dynamics starting from $x_{0}$ converge to $\\bar{x}$. In other terms, $$\\lim_{t \\rightarrow +\\infty} x_{t} = \\bar{x}.$$\nTo determine whether a steady state is stable we analyse whether the function converges towards that steady state. We typically use first-order conditions to determine the stability. However, these only apply to hyperbolic steady states.\nHyperbolic steady states Assume that $f$ is differentiable. Let $\\bar{x}$ be a steady state of $f$.\nIf $|f^{\\prime}(\\bar{x}) = 1|,$ then the steady state is non-hyperbolic. If $|f^{\\prime}(\\bar{x}) \\neq 1|,$ then the steady state is hyperbolic. First-order stability Suppose that $\\bar{x}$ is a hyperbolic steady state of $f$. Then\nif $|f^{\\prime}(\\bar{x})| \u0026lt; 1$ then $\\bar{x}$ is locally stable, if $|f^{\\prime}(\\bar{x})| \u0026gt; 1$ then $\\bar{x}$ is unstable. Page 316 of de la Croix and Michel provides the proof.\nIntuitively, the condition for stability requires that we approach the steady state slowly. In other terms, the curvature of $f$ is smaller than 1. Therefore, although $x_{t}$ grows over time, every time the increase in its value becomes smaller, eventually tending towards zero.\nExample: let $x_{t} = f(x_{t-1}) = x_{t-1}^{0.5}$. This first-order difference equation has two steady states: $\\bar{x}_{1} = 0$ and $\\bar{x}_{2} = 1.$ The first derivative is $f^{\\prime} = 0.5 x_{t-1}^{-0.5}.$ Evaluating it at the steady states results in the following:\n$$ \\lim_{\\bar{x} \\rightarrow {\\bar{x}_{1}}^{+}} |f^{\\prime}(\\bar{x}_{1})| = + \\infty, $$ $$ |f^{\\prime}(\\bar{x}_{2})| = 0.5 \u0026lt; 1.$$\nTherefore, $\\bar{x}_{1}= 0$ is an unstable steady state, while $\\bar{x}_{2} = 1$ is stable. Below, we plot two trajectories of $x_{t}$ when $x_{t} = x_{t-1}^{0.5}:$ one starting below the steady state $x_{0} \u0026lt; 1$ and the other above.\nStarting from $x_{0} \u0026lt; \\bar{x}_{2}$, the variable slowly increases until it reaches the steady state $\\bar{x}_{2}.$ Notice how the curvature of the function decreases (and is smaller than one), generating the convergence. We can reason similarly for the case $x_{0} \u0026gt; \\bar{x}_{2}.$\nFirst-order systems of difference equations A system of first-order difference equations takes the form:\n$$\\begin{eqnarray} x^{1}_{t+1} \u0026amp; = f^{1}(x^{1}_{t}, …","date":1562803200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562803200,"objectID":"b1bdd68d796fe1de432e9b6f1591b51f","permalink":"https://example.com/courses/macroeconomics/math_app/steady_state/","publishdate":"2019-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/macroeconomics/math_app/steady_state/","section":"courses","summary":"This note is based on Appendix A.3.2 of de la Croix and Michel: A Theory of Economic Growth.\nMacroeconomic models often have dynamic equations relating different periods of time.

As before, we assume perfect foresight for individuals. Assumption OLG.1 Individuals have perfect foresight.\nWhen young, they are endowed with one unit of labour that they supply inestastically. Assumption OLG.2 Individuals supply one unit of labour inelastically when young. They receive the ongoing wage rate $w_{t}$ and allocate this income between:\ncurrent consumption $c_{t}$, savings $s_{t}$ that are invested in the firms. Therefore, the budget constraint of a young individual in period $t$ is:\n$$ w_{t} = c_{t} + s_{t}.$$\nOnce an individual reaches old age the next period, he consumes his savings (plus the interest rate received), reproduces —exogenous fertility at rate $n$— and dies. Old people do not care about anything happening after death. Therefore, an agent has one unique choice:\nconsumption when adult, $d_{t+1}.$ The budget constraint for this period is:1\n$$s_{t}(1 - \\delta + r_{t+1}) = d_{t+1}.$$\nwith $\\delta \\in (0,1)$ being the capital depreciation rate.\nHence, an individual faces two budget constraints. However, we can collapse both into a unique intertemporal budget constraint.\nThe intertemporal budget constraint In the economy, we have consumption as the numeraire. It is more convenient for us to combine the two budget constraints corresponding to young and old ages into one single constraint. Starting from\n$$\\left. \\begin{eqnarray} w_{t} = c_{t} + s_{t} \\\\\\ d_{t+1} = s_{t}(1 - \\delta + r_{t+1}) = s_{t} R_{t+1} \\end{eqnarray} \\right\\}.$$\nwhere $R_{t} \\equiv 1 - \\delta + r_{t+1}$ represents the return on savings, isolate $s_{t}$ in the second equation and plug it in the first one:\n$$ w_{t} = c_{t} + \\frac{d_{t+1}}{R_{t+1}}. \\tag{1, Int. Budget Const.} \\label{eq:budget}$$\nThe intertemporal budget constraint indicates that the total present value of income ($w_{t}$, the only source of income) equals the total present value of expenditures. The present value of consumption when old $d_{t+1}$ is discounted using the interest rate $R_{t+1}.$\nIt is clear that savings, as usual, will be a function of wages $w$ and interests $R.$ So will consumption at all periods of time.\nUtility function We suppose that the life-cycle utility function is additively separable:\n$$U(c,d) = u( c ) + \\beta u(d),, \\beta \\in(0,1) \\tag{2, Utility} \\label{eq:utility}$$\nwhere $\\beta \\in (0,1)$ is the psychological discount factor. We assume that $u( c )$ has the properties\nAssumption OLG.3\nOLG.3.1 $u^{\\prime}( c ) \u0026gt; 0,$ OLG.3.2 $u^{\\prime \\prime} ( c ) \u0026lt; 0,$ OLG.3.3 $ \\lim_{c \\rightarrow 0} u^{\\prime}( c) = +\\infty.$ The last assumption $\\lim_{c \\rightarrow 0} u^{\\prime}( c ) = +\\infty$ implies that an individual will always have a positive consumption —as long as he has enough income to finance it.\nAnother important implication of the choice of the utility formulation is that $c$ and $d$ are normal goods: the demand is not decreasing in wealth. It follows from additive separability and concavity. In the Appendix we discuss it in more detail for a non-separable utility function.\nThe behaviour of individuals At time $t$, young individuals receive their wages, consume and save while maximising the utility function.\n$$\\begin{eqnarray} \u0026amp; \\max u(c_{t}) + \\beta u(d_{t+1}) \\\\\\ \u0026amp; \\mathrm{s.t.} \\quad w_{t} = c_{t} + s_{t} \\\\\\ \u0026amp; \\phantom{s.t.} \\quad d_{t+1} = R_{t+1}s_{t} \\\\\\ \u0026amp; \\phantom{s.t.} \\quad c_{t} \\geq 0, d_{t+1} \\geq 0. \\end{eqnarray}$$\nWe have two possibilities to solve this problem:\nSubstitution First, we can substitute $c_{t}$ and $d_{t+1}$ in the utility function, leading to:\n$$u(w_{t} - s_{t}) + \\beta u(R_{t+1}s_{t}).$$\nThis function is strictly concave with respect to $s_{t}$ because of our assumptions. The solution is the savings function:\n$$s_{t} = s(w_{t}, R_{t+1}).$$\nThe solution is interior as a consequence of the assumptions, and it is characterised by the first-order condition:\n$$u^{\\prime}(w_{t} - s_{t}) = \\beta R_{t+1} u^{\\prime}(R_{t+1}s_{t}).$$\nLagrangian Instead, we can use the intertemporal budget constraint and build the Lagrangian:\n$$\\mathcal{L} = u(c_{t}) + \\beta u(d_{t+1}) + \\lambda_{t}(w_{t} - c_{t} - \\frac{d_{t+1}}{R_{t+1}}).$$\nThe first order conditions imply that:\n$$u^{\\prime}(c_{t}) = \\lambda_{t}, \\quad \\beta u^{\\prime}(d_{t+1}) = \\frac{\\lambda_{t}}{R_{t+1}}$$\nCombining both, we obtain the Euler equation:\n$$u^{\\prime}(c_{t}) = \\beta R_{t+1} u^\\prime (d_{t+1}).$$\nThere plenty of alternative notations for the OLG model. One may write $c^{y}_{t}$ and $c^{o}_{t}$ for young and adult consumption. Similarly, the subindeces $t, t+1, \\ldots$ denote the period of consumption, but we could have denoted the period in which the individual was born. ↩︎\n","date":1562803200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562803200,"objectID":"f2f4d94234dcb2c9061d7cb0c8fa5a7a","permalink":"https://example.com/courses/macroeconomics/olg/olg_households/","publishdate":"2019-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/macroeconomics/olg/olg_households/","section":"courses","summary":"Building the budget constraint Individuals live for two periods.

However, the gains o trade are not euqally shared among all citizens. For instance, trade liberalization may benefit consumers by reducing the cost of the goods they want to consume, but at the same time hurt the local producers of these very same products, who now face international competition. Moreover, although it may be posible for the winners to compensate the losers and still be better off (after all, trade is usually Pareto efficient), such implementation is nearely impossible. For instance, it would require that all consumers of imported goods pay a “tax” to the loosing industries, which is expensive to implement. Since the losers are typically less and can coordinate more easily, in general they successfully block trade liberalization. After all, the general public who would benefit gains very little, and thus is not that much concerned.\nWe can classify trade policy tools in two broad categories, depending on whether they act upon prices or quantities\nTrariff barriers Non-tariff barriers. In general, protection against foreign trade appears in the form of tariffs, a tax that an importer thas to pay to ship the goods into the country.

We rely on the phase diagram for this analysis: it conveys the message quite efficiently. In what follows, we assume that the economy is at its steady-state level $(\\bar{k}^{\\mathcal{Gov}}, \\bar{c}^{\\mathcal{Gov}})$ when the government decides to change $G_t.$ Furthermore, we assume taxes are constant at some level $G_{t} = G_{1} \u0026gt; 0.$\nUnexpected, permanent rise in $G$ Suppose that the government announces a sudden and unexpected increase in $G: G_{2} \u0026gt; G_{1}.$ The Ramsey model illustrates the consequences of such a change.\nFirst, we assumed that the economy was at its steady state. The change in $G$, as we discussed before, moves the $k$-locus closer to the horizontal axis.\nWith the change in $G$, a new steady state emerges. The steady-state capital level $\\bar{k}^\\mathcal{Gov}(G_2) = \\bar{k}^\\mathcal{Gov}(G_{1})$ remains the same. However, households need to adjust their consumption level. Otherwise, they would not be on the saddle path, and they would follow a diverging trajectory leading to zero consumption. The unique possibility that puts the economy in the new steady state is for consumption to jump directly into it. This is, consumption must be reduced by the amount $\\Delta_{G} = G_{2} - G_{1}.$ Thus the size of the immediate fall in consumption is equal to the full amount of the increase in government purchases, and the capital stock and the real interest rate are unaffected.\nA similar policy under the Solow model would have implied a smaller reduction in consumption. In Solow, consumption is the fraction $1-s$ of current income. The tax decreases current income by $G$, but consumption would only change by $(1-s)G \u0026lt; G.$ Hence, the remaining part of the increase in $G$ is absorbed by a reduction in investments of the size $sG$: government purchases crowd out investment in the Solow model.\nUnexpected, temporary rise in $G$ Different from before, suppose that the increase in $G$ is only temporary, starting at $t=t_{0}$ and lasting until $t=t_{1}.$ We still suppose that the increase in taxes is unexpected. One possibility is to first jump to the new steady state, remain there while taxes are high, and at time $t=t_{1}$ jump back to the original steady state. However, this implies two discontinuities in consumption: the first and second jumps. This would imply that marginal utility falls discontinuously and this is not optimal.\nThere is a second possibility. First, decrease consumption by a smaller amount than before: $\\Delta_{c} \u0026lt; \\Delta_{G}.$ This implies that the economy is not in the new steady state $(\\bar{k}^\\mathcal{Gov}(G_2) , \\bar{c}^{\\mathcal{Gov}}(G_{2}))$, but above it. Thus, it is subject to the dynamics implied by the phase diagram: capital decreases and consumption increases. The initial jump in consumption must be carefully computed such that, at time $t=t_{1}$, the dynamics implied by $G_{2}$ put the economy on the saddle path of $G_{1}.$ This is, the economy undergoes a transition such that, at $t=t_{1}$ when taxes and dynamics —and the phase diagram— return to the original configuration, the economy is on its saddle path.\nThe figure above depicts in black the original $k$-locus —for $G=G_{1}$— and in red the temporary one while with $G=G_{2}.$ The economy first jumps from the initial steady state $(\\bar{k}^{\\mathcal{Gov}}(G_{1}), \\bar{c}^{\\mathcal{Gov}}(G_{1}))$ following the black arrow. From then onwards, the dynamics of the red $k$-locus determine the trajectory of the economy. In particular, it moves north-west following the orange curve. The initial jump is calculated in such a way that at $t=t_{1}$ the economy is on the saddle path corresponding to $G=G_{1}.$ From there, it simply follows the saddle path towards the steady state $(\\bar{k}^{\\mathcal{Gov}}(G_{1}), \\bar{c}^{\\mathcal{Gov}}(G_{1})).$\nDuring the transition, households reduce capital to sustain a higher and increasing level of consumption that would not be possible with $G_{2} \u0026gt; G_{1}.$ From $t=t_{1}$, consumption continues to grow, but capital starts accumulating again.\nThe change in consumption during $t=t_{0}$ is directly proportional to the length of the increase in taxes. The longer it is, the closer the economy jumps to the steady state $(\\bar{k}^{\\mathcal{Gov}}(G_{2}), \\bar{c}^{\\mathcal{Gov}}(G_{2})).$ However, it never reaches it: households always decrease their savings, which allows them to later be on the saddle path when taxes go back to $G_{1}.$\nAnticipated, permanent rise in $G$ Note: when analysing an anticipated measure, start from the end move backwards.\nSuppose that at time $t=t_{0}$ the government announces that at time $t=t_{1}$ taxes will permanently increase.\nOne possibility is to mimic the [unanticipated, permanent change](\u0026lt;{{ ref “#un_perm” \u0026gt;}}): remain at the original steady state $(\\bar{k}^\\mathcal{Gov}(G_{0}), \\bar{c}^\\mathcal{Gov}(G_{0}))$ until $t_{1}$, and then jump onto the new steady state.

Before turning to it, we compute the intertemporal elasticity of substitution on this model, because it turns out to be a crucial element influencing savings. The intertemporal elasticity of substitution is a special case of the elasticity of substitution, that measures how the ratio of future to present consumption changes with the relative price (the interest rate).\nIntertemporal elasticity of substitution The intertemporal elasticity of substitution is defined as:\n$$\\epsilon_{d_{t+1}, c_{t}} = \\frac{ \\partial \\left( \\frac{d_{t+1}}{c_{t}} \\right)}{\\partial R_{t+1}} \\frac{ R_{t+1}}{\\left( \\frac{d_{t+1}}{c_{t}} \\right)}.$$\nFrom the Euler equation we have $\\frac{u^{\\prime}(c_{t})}{u^{\\prime}(d_{t+1})} = \\beta R_{t+1}.$ So, consumption when old $d_{t+1}$ is going to be proportional to consumption when young $c_{t}.$\nLet $d_{t+1} = x_{t+1} c_{t}.$ Then, the intertemporal elasticity of substitution becomes:\n$$\\epsilon_{d_{t+1}, c_{t}} = \\frac{ \\partial x_{t+1}}{\\partial R_{t+1}} \\frac{ R_{t+1}}{x_{t+1}}.$$\nWe can compute it using the Euler equation $u^\\prime(c_{t}) = \\beta R_{t+1} u^\\prime(x_{t+1}c_t).$ In fact, totally differentiating on both sides yields\n$$0 = \\beta u^\\prime(x_{t+1}c_t)\\mathrm{d}R_{t+1} + \\beta R_{t+1}u^{\\prime \\prime}(x_{t+1}c_t) c_{t} \\mathrm{d}x_{t+1}.$$\nHence,\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x_{t+1}}{\\mathrm{d}R_{t+1}} = - \\frac{u^\\prime(x_{t+1}c_{t})}{R_{t+1}u^{\\prime \\prime}(x_{t+1}c_t)c_t} = - \\frac{u^\\prime (d_{t+1})}{R_{t+1}u^{\\prime \\prime}(d_{t+1})c_t}.$$\nThe intertemporal elasticity of substitution is then given by:\n$$\\epsilon_{d_{t+1}, c_{t}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}x_{t+1}}{\\mathrm{d}R_{t+1}}\\frac{R_{t+1}}{x_{t+1}} = - \\frac{u^\\prime (d_{t+1})}{R_{t+1}u^{\\prime \\prime}(d_{t+1})c_t}\\frac{R_{t+1}}{\\underbrace{x_{t+1}}_{\\frac{d_{t+1}}{c_{t}}}} = - \\frac{u^\\prime(d_{t+1})}{u^{\\prime \\prime}(d_{t+1}) d_{t+1}}.$$\nNote: the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is equal to the inverse of the coefficient of relative risk aversion. Risk averse individuals do not want large changes in consumption, so they have a large risk aversion and are not willing to trade off future and present consumption. Conversely, risk neutral individuals do not mind abrupt changes in consumption, so they are willing to trade off future and present consumption.\nHence, in this model, the intertemporal elasticity of substitution coincides with the inverse of the coefficient of relative risk aversion. Note: If you read p. 12 in de la Croix and Michel, they take a different approach and also refuse to use the concept or risk aversion: the model does not feature risk.\nCIES example We illustrate the previous concept using a constant intertemporal elasticity of substitution utility function:\n$$u( c ) = \\frac{c^{1-\\frac{1}{\\sigma}}}{1-\\frac{1}{\\sigma}}.$$\nIn this case, we have the following Euler condition:\n$$u^{\\prime}(c_{t}) = \\beta R_{t+1} u^{\\prime}(d_{t+1}) \\implies \\frac{d_{t+1}}{c_{t}} = \\left( \\beta R_{t+1} \\right)^\\sigma.$$\nTherefore, the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is\n$$\\epsilon_{d_{t+1}, c_{t}} = \\frac{ \\partial \\frac{d_{t+1}}{c_{t}} }{\\partial R_{t+1}} \\frac{R_{t+1}}{\\color{red}{\\frac{d_{t+1}}{c_{t}}}}= \\sigma (\\beta R_{t+1})^{\\sigma-1}\\beta R_{t+1} \\color{red}{\\frac{1}{(\\beta R_{t+1})^{\\sigma}}} = \\sigma. $$\nMeanwhile, the coefficient of relative risk aversion\n$$RRA( c ) = - \\frac{u^{\\prime \\prime}( c )}{u^{\\prime}( c )}c = \\frac{1}{\\sigma} = \\epsilon^{-1}_{d_{t+1},c_{t}}$$\nis the inverse of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution.\nThe savings function The savings function arises from solving:\n$$s(w, R) = \\arg \\max \\left[ u(w-s) + \\beta u(Rs) \\right].$$\nTaking the first derivative with respect to $s$ and solving provides an implicit function: the savings function.\n$$u^\\prime(w-s)(-1) + \\beta u^\\prime(Rs)R = 0.$$\nDenote this function $\\phi(s,w,R)$:\n$$\\phi(s, w, R ) = -u^\\prime(w-s)+ \\beta R u^\\prime(Rs) = 0.$$\nFollowing from the assumption on the utility function, the savings function is continuous and continuously differentiable.\nWe are interested in determining whether savings increase or decrease with wealth and the interest rate.\nThe effect of wages We begin by analysing the effect of wages on savings:\n$$\\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial w} = - \\frac{\\frac{\\partial \\phi(\\cdot)}{\\partial w}}{\\frac{\\partial \\phi(\\cdot)}{\\partial s}} = - \\frac{ - u^{\\prime \\prime}(w-s)}{u^{\\prime \\prime}(w-s)+\\beta R^{2} u^{\\prime \\prime}(Rs)} = \\frac{1}{\\underbrace{1+\\beta R^{2} \\underbrace{\\frac{u^{\\prime \\prime}(Rs)}{u^{\\prime \\prime}(w-s)}}_{\u0026gt;0}}_{\u0026gt;1}} \\in (0,1).$$\nWe thus have that the marginal propensity to save out of income is between 0 and 1: $0 \u0026lt; s^{\\prime}_{w} \u0026lt; 1,$ which reflects the fact that consumption goods are normal goods.\nThe effect of the interest rate Similarly, we compute the derivative of $\\frac{\\partial s(w,R)}{\\partial R}$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial R} = -\\frac{ \\beta u^{\\prime}(d) + \\beta R s u^{\\prime \\prime}(d)}{u^{\\prime …","date":1562803200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562803200,"objectID":"ef9beeb74b20b07e87ff3dc0e696c5d6","permalink":"https://example.com/courses/macroeconomics/olg/olg_savings_function/","publishdate":"2019-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/macroeconomics/olg/olg_savings_function/","section":"courses","summary":"We now study how savings are affected by the remaining variables of the model.

Therefore, if a country imported goods at the world price $p^w$, after the introduction of a tariff imported goods are more expensive because they now bear an extra tax. This tax may take two forms:\nA percentage increase $p^w(1+\\tau)$, called ad-valorem, A unitary increase $p^w + \\tau$, called specific tariff. Both are equivalent, and one can always find the corresponding percentage increase for a given unitary rise or vice-versa.\nAs we shall see, the effects of a tariff are different depending on the size of the country. First, we will analyze the small-country case, this is, a country whose relative size in the international markers is small and cannot influence equilibrium prices. Related to the Standard Trade model, a country is small if the changes in its supply or demand schedule do not move the world supply or demand.1 Then, we will analyze the same tariff but when it is applied in a large country, one that has the ability to influence world prices.\nTariffs in a small, open economy The initial situation is that of a country that is importing the good $X$. This happens because the autarkic equilibrium price, this is, the one that would prevail without trade ($p$), is higher than the world price ($p^w$) of good $X$. Then, if trade is possible and there are no tariffs, consumers will prefer to import the good and pay the lower internationa price rather than buying from the more expensive local producers. The next Figure represents this initial situation: at price $p^w$, the country experiences excess demand, hence it imports the good. Since the country is small, it can import any quantity it desires at the ongoing world price. So, the world supply curve is perfectly elastic. At price $p^w$, demand is $D^1$ and supply is $S^1$. The difference between the two is the amount of imports. As we can see, at price $p^w$ there is some local production: only the most efficient producers can supply at a price equal or lower than $p^w$. From the perspective of a local firm, the situation is simple: if it asks a price above $p^w$, sales are zero because it is always possible to import at $p^w$. If the price it asks is lower, the firm could gain more by adjusting it to $p^w$.\nNext, we suppose that the government introduces a tariff $\\tau \u0026gt; 0$ on imports. Imports are still possible, however, the price of these goods is now $p^w + \\tau$. Notice that now more local firms produce: in fact, some that before were not sufficiently efficient to produce below $p^w$ can now produce because the relevant price is $p^w + \\tau$. So, local supply increases. At the same time, with a higher price, demand shrinks. The combined effect is a decrease in the imports: less demand combined with a higher local supply.\nLastly, the government raises some revenue through the tariff. For each imported good, it receives the tariff $\\tau$. Therefore, the total government revenue is $(D^2 - S^2)\\tau$.\nHence, after the tariff is introduced:\nLocal producers are better off: they sell more and at a higher price. Consumers are worse off: the price has increased. The government raises some revenue. It is normal to ask: in general, is the economy better off with the tariff? In the case of a small country the answer is no. We can proof this. Total consumer’s surplus before the tax was equal to the area below the demand curve, reaching until $D^1$, net of the purchase cost. After the tariff, their surplus only extends until $D^2$, and because $D^2 \u0026lt; D^1$, it is clearly smaller. However, if we aggregate all surplus changes, the entire result is a net loss of welfare, a dead-weight loss. Figures below illustrate it for linear supply and demand functions. The consumer lost surplus equal to the area represented by the orange trapezoid. The loss comprises two different aspects: consumers buy less quantity, and they do so at a higher price. The opposite is true for producers, represented by the blue area. Notice how part of the surplus lost by consumers goes directly to the producers: they now satisfy a part of the demand that previously consisted of imports. Lastly, the government gains the surplus depicted by the green rectangle. If add them together, the result is that the two red triangles are lost, hence the economy as whole is worse off. Tariffs in a large economy The main difference between a small and a large economy is their capacity to influence the world price. Suppose for instance that the world consists of only two countries: if Home imports the good X, then Home has monopsony power. In general, we say that a large country capable of influencing world prices faces an upwards supply curve. We can derive this curve, as well as the world demand curve, from each country’s supply and demand schedules. Suppose, for a given good, that the autarky price at Home is higher than a Foreign. Consumers at Home will be willing to import the less expensive Foreign good, and hence, there will be internation demand …","date":1562803200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562803200,"objectID":"ebff8637fc5f291e234efee3aae74e54","permalink":"https://example.com/courses/international_trade/tariffs/","publishdate":"2019-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/international_trade/tariffs/","section":"courses","summary":"Tariffs","tags":null,"title":"Tariffs","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The transversality condition appears as a necessary condition to determine the optimal path in dynamic models. It complements the Euler equation and allows to pinpoint the exact optimal path (see example below).\nWe use the transversality condition to avoid explosive consumption or saving paths that would end up in:\nExcessive consumption, driving the capital stock of the economy to zero and impeding future consumption, Excessive savings, up to the point that a large amount of the output is devoted to replace capital that depreciates. Indeed, using only the Euler equation alongside with initial conditions allows for infinitely many optimal paths to be found. The Ramsey problem does not state any final value for capital $k_{t=T}$ (in fact, it does not even state a final period $T$ because $T \\rightarrow \\infty).$ Therefore, working only with the Euler equation and the initial stock of capital $k_{t=0} = k_{0}$ allows for infinitely optimal paths. In the following example, we try to solve the simple cake-eating problem without imposing the transversality condition, and obtain infinitely many solutions.\nExample: Cake-eating problem We try to maximise utility from eating a finite cake over an infinite amount of time. The size of the cake ($k$) is given: $k_{t=0} = k_0 \\ \u0026gt; 0.$ The problem reads:\n$$\\begin{eqnarray} \\max \u0026amp; \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\beta^{t} \\ln ( c_{t} ) \\\\\\ \u0026amp; k_{t+1} = k_{t} - c_{t} \\\\\\ \u0026amp; k_{t=0} = k_{0} \\end{eqnarray}$$\nWe solve it noting that we can decide on $c_{t}$ and $k_{t}.$ The Lagrangian is: $$\\mathcal{L} = \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\beta^{t} \\ln (c_{t}) + \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\lambda_{t} (k_{t+1} - k_{t} + c_{t}).$$ Taking derivatives with respect to $c_{t}$ and $k_{t}$, and noticing that $k_{t}$ appears together with the $\\lambda_{t-1}$ term gives us the Euler equation: $$c_{t+1} = \\beta c_{t}.$$ Hence, iterating, $c_{t} = \\beta^{t}c_{0}$ Plugging it in the constraint gives us: $k_{t+1} = k_{t} - \\beta^{t}c_{0}.$ Solving for $k_{t}$ gives us $k_{t} = D - \\frac{c_{0}(1-\\beta^{t})}{1-\\beta}.$ At this point, we can no longer proceed (we have the unknown $D$) unless we have the extra restriction given by the transversality condition. If we use it, which reads, $\\lim_{t \\rightarrow \\infty} \\beta^{t} u^{\\prime} (c_{t})k_{t+1}=0$ we can substitute $c_{t} = \\beta^{t} c_{0}$. Therefore: $\\lim_{t \\rightarrow \\infty} \\beta^{t} \\frac{1}{c_{t} k_{t+1}} = \\lim_{t \\rightarrow \\infty} \\beta^{t} \\frac{1}{\\beta^{t} c_{0}} k_{t+1} = \\lim_{t \\rightarrow \\infty} k_{t+1} = 0.$ So, at the limit, the size of the cake becomes zero, and we eat it completely. Note: This makes sense, because utility is increasing in consumption and leaving something behind would be a waste of resources.\nNow, with this additional information ($\\lim_{t \\rightarrow \\infty} k_{t+1} = 0$) we can close the problem using: $k_{t+1} = D - \\frac{c_{0}(1-\\beta^{t-1})}{1-\\beta}$. Hence $\\lim_{t \\rightarrow \\infty} k_{t+1} = \\lim_{t \\rightarrow \\infty} D - \\frac{c_{0}(1-\\beta^{t-1})}{1-\\beta} = D - \\frac{c_{0}}{1-\\beta} = 0.$ Therefore, $D = \\frac{c_{0}}{1-\\beta}$ which implies that $k_{t} = \\frac{c_{0}\\beta^{t}}{1-\\beta}$. Since $k_{t=0} = k_{0}$ we can easily obtain $c_{0}$ from: $k_{0} = \\frac{c_{0}}{1-\\beta} \\implies c_{0} = (1-\\beta)k_{0}.$\nFinally, we have that $c_{t} = \\beta^{t} c_{0} = \\beta^{t}(1-\\beta)k_{0}.$\nNote: This problem is more easily solved assuming since the beginning that the entire cake will be consumed. This is, $\\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} c_{t} = k_{0}$. In that case, the Lagrangian is: $\\mathcal{L} = \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\beta^{t} \\ln (c_{t}) + \\lambda (\\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} c_{t} - k_{0}).$ Notice that in this case we have only one $\\lambda$. It is simple to show that $c_{t} = \\beta c_{t-1}.$ Substituting this information in the constraint gives us $k_{0} = \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\beta^{t} c_{0} = \\frac{c_{0}}{1-\\beta}.$ Therefore, $c_{t} = \\beta^t (1-\\beta)k_{0}.$ There is one important remark regarding this alternative method. It indirectly uses the transversality condition. Remember that we obtained that $\\lim_{t \\rightarrow \\infty} k_{t+1} = 0$ which implies that the entire cake is consumed. In the alternative method we assumed it, which makes sense just by looking at the utility formulation.\nA wrong proof of the transversality condition In some cases the transversality constraint is justified as the limit when time goes to infinity of an equivalent problem with a finite horizon. This is, one can write an optimal program that ends at some specific period. For instance, our Ramsey problem with a terminal state can be written as: $$\\max_{c_{t}, k_{t+1}} \\sum_{t=0}^{T} \\beta^{t} u(c_{t}).$$\nWe impose that capital must be positive all periods: $k_{t+1} \\geq 0.$ Write the Lagrangian that corresponds to the Kuhn-Tucker problem:\n$$\\mathcal{L} = \\sum_{t=0}^{T} \\beta^{t} u(c_{t}) + \\sum_{t=0}^{T} \\lambda_{t}(w_{t} + r_{t} k_{t} + (1-\\delta)k_{t} - c_{t} - k_{t+1}) + \\sum_{t=0}^{T} \\mu_{t}k_{t+1}.$$\nTaking the appropriate derivatives with respect to …","date":1562803200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562803200,"objectID":"9e9b7cd90bcfc950cf261103ac0e4525","permalink":"https://example.com/courses/macroeconomics/math_app/transversality_condition/","publishdate":"2019-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/macroeconomics/math_app/transversality_condition/","section":"courses","summary":"The transversality condition appears as a necessary condition to determine the optimal path in dynamic models.

Chacune des époque se caractérise une combinaison particulier des variables (ou des dynamiques des variables) sous-jacentes suivantes:\nFertilité et sa relation avec le revenu per capita (positive ou negative). Investissement dans l’éducation (positive ou zéro). Enfin, il faut signaler que chaque époque a une durée temporelle différente. Ainsi, l’époque Malthusienne est la plus longue, prenant dès l’apparition des êtres humains modernes jusqu’à le 18è siècle pour les pays développés. Ensuite, l’époque post-Malthusienne prend les siècles 18è et 19è, et à partir de ce point là, on entre dans l’époque moderne. Enfin, avant d’entrer dans le détail, il est nécessaire de décrire le rôle de l’éducation dans le modèle.\nÉducation et capital humain dans le modèle unifié de croissance économique Dans le modèle unifié de croissance économique, les parents investissent dans l’éducation des enfants parce qu’ils attirent de l’utilité de leur niveau de capital humain, et celui-là est fortement influencé par le niveau d’éducation. L’hypothèse que les parents préférent avoir des enfants éduqués est una maniẽre simple et typique de représenter des préférences plus complexes:\nLes parents s’intéressent au futur salaire des enfants, et le salaire augmente avec le niveau éducatif. Les parents ont une simple préférence pour l’éducation, Une nouveauté de la théorie unifiée de la croisance économique est qu’elle introduit la possibilité que le capital humain se déprecie, et la vitesse de la dépréciation est une fonction du niveau technologique (voir en dessous). En plus, on suppose que tous les enfants sont équipés d’un certain niveau de capital humain, même si leurs parents n’investissent pas dans l’éducation. Ces deux hypothèses, innocentes en principe, ont des profondes consequénces sur l’évolution de l’éducation.\nDépreciation du capital humain La prèmiere hypothèse peut s’expliquer de la manière suivante. Imaginons une société dans laquelle le niveau technologique est faible et ne change pas. Alors, tout ce qu’on apprend pendant la jeunesse (un métier, par exemple) va rester utile tout la vie. Par exemple, si on apprend à utiliser une scie ou un marteu, ces connaissances restent valides autant que les outils ne changent pas. Pour tant, éduquer les enfants n’apporte des avantages, car la technologie va rester la même. Par contre, si maintenant on suppose que la technologie change rapidement, il est possible que les outils de demain ne soient pas une scie et un marteu, mais une scie controlée par ordinateur et un marteau pnéumatique. Dans ce cas-là, les connaisances acquises pendant la jeunesse sont vite dépassées, et pour tant, si on fournie aux enfants de l’éducation ils seront mieux équipés pour s’adapter à la nouvelle situation. Ainsi, les parents doivent procurer à leurs enfants de l’éducation pour amortir la dépréciation du capital humain dû au progrès technique.\nNiveau minimal de capital humain Comment on a dit auparavent, il est raisonable que même sans un investissement exprès en capital humain, un certain niveau est toujours atteint. Par exemple, on apprend certaines choses, y compris des métiers, par la simple observation.\nImplications Les implications de ces hypothèses sont claires: vu que les enfants sont équipés d’un niveau minimum de capital humain, et vu qu’avec un faible progrès technologique l’éducation n’est pas nécéssaire, les investissements en éducation ne deviendran positifs qu’avec le temps. Autrement dit, quand les ressources sont peu abondantes, les parents préférent les affecter à la nourriture et au nombre d’enfants plutôt qu’à l’éducation. Seulement à partir d’un certain niveau de richesse (l’éducation est un bien de luxe dans ce modèle) ou de progrès technologique il y aura des investissements dans l’éducation.\nChangement technologique Pour finir, le modèle postule que la technologie avance grâce à deux effets:\nD’un côté, on suppose que les gens ont, de manière aléatoire, des nouvelles idées qui augmentent le niveau technologique. Ainsi, une population plus large aura une nouvelle idée avec une plus grande probabilité, et pour tant, l’avancement technologique sera plus important. De l’autre côté, l’investissement dans l’éducation pousse le niveau technologique, car les gens avec plus de connaissances ont plus de probabilité d’inventer et innover. Époque Malthusienne Cette période représente la plus longue durée du modèle et comprend le temps entre l’apparition des êtres humains modernes (homo sapiens) il y a environ 100 000 ans jusqu’à debout du 18è siècle.

Moreover, they do so inelastically. During period $t$ there are $N_{t}$ young agents and, hence, the supply of labour is $N_{t}$. Equating this to labour demand from firms $L_{t}$ gives the wage rate: $$w_{t} = \\omega\\left(\\frac{K_{t}}{N_{t}}\\right)=\\omega(k_{t}).$$\nCapital market: Only old individuals own capital. Since firms operate competitively, they make zero profits. Hence, $f^{\\prime}(k_{t})K_{t}$ is distributed as interests. Old households receive $N_{t-1}R_{t}s_{t-1} = R_{t}K_{t}.$ So, what old households receive must equal what firms distribute In other terms: $R_{t}K_{t}= f^{\\prime}(k_{t}) K_{t}$ and $R_t = f^\\prime (k_t).$\nGood market: Finding the equilibrium for this market departs from the otherwise similar Ramsey case. Remember that we have two types of agents: young and old. Total production is given by: $$Y_{t} = F(K_{t}, N_{t}) = \\color{red}{N_{t}} f(k_{t}).$$ Total demand for goods combines the consumption of $d_{t}$, the old generation living in period $t$, and the demand for consumption and investment from the young: $c_{t}, s_{t}.$ Therefore, counting how many old and young individuals live during period $t$ we have that total demand equals: $$N_{t-1}d_{t} + N_{t}(c_{t}+s_{t}).$$ The equilibrium on the goods market implies: $$Y_{t} = N_{t-1}d_{t} + N_{t}(c_{t}+s_{t}).$$\nAlso, we can check that total production equals total consumption: $$N_{t}(c_{t}+s_{t}) = N_{t}w_{t}=N_{t}(f(k_{t})-k_{t}f^{\\prime}(k_{t})) = Y_{t}-K_{t}f^{\\prime}(k_{t}),$$ $$N_{t-1}d_{t} = N_{t-1}R_{t}s_{t-1} = R_{t}K_{t} = K_{t}f^{\\prime}(k_{t}).$$\nA temporary equilibrium is a set $\\{w_{t}, R_{t}, K_{t}, L_{t}, Y_{t}, k_{t}, I_{t}, c_{t}, s_{t}, d_{t}\\}$ that satisfies:\n$$\\begin{eqnarray} w_{t} = \\omega(k_{t}), \\\\\\ R_{t} = f^{\\prime}(k_{t}), \\\\\\ L_{t} = N_{t}, \\\\\\ Y_{t} = N_{t}f(k_{t}), \\\\\\ Y_{t} = N_{t-1}d_t + N_{t}(c_{t}+s_{t}) \\\\\\ I_{t} = N_{t}s_{t}, \\\\\\ c_{t} = w_{t} - s_{t}, \\\\\\ s_{t} = s(\\omega(k_{t}),R_{t+1}), \\\\\\ d_{t} = R_{t}s_{t-1}. \\end{eqnarray}$$\nThe existence of a temporary equilibrium is guaranteed because the functions are single-valued.\nIntertemporal equilibrium with perfect foresight The equilibrium equation that links two consecutive periods is the capital accumulation equation. In particular, the savings of young individuals at period $t$ are transformed into productive capital at $t+1.$\nNote: in this model, it is useful to write the equations first in aggregate terms and then convert them to its intensive-form representation.\n$$K_{t+1} = N_{t}s_{t} = N_{t} s\\left( \\omega(k_{t}), R_{t+1} \\right).$$\nIn intensive form:\n$$k_{t+1} = \\frac{K_{t+1}}{\\color{red}{N_{t+1}}} = \\frac{N_{t}}{\\color{red}{N_{t+1}}} s\\left( \\omega(k_{t}), R_{t+1} \\right) = \\frac{1}{1+n}s\\left( \\omega(k_{t}), R_{t+1} \\right) .$$\nFinally, we can incorporate the equilibrium in the capital market (together with perfect foresight) and replace $R_{t+1} = f^{\\prime}(k_{t+1}):$\n$$k_{t+1} =\\frac{1}{1+n}s \\left( \\omega(k_{t}), f^{\\prime}(k_{t+1}) \\right).$$\nIntertemporal equilibrium (for perfect foresigt): Given an initial capital stock $k_{0} = K_{0} \\big{/} N_{-1}$, an intertemporal equilibrium (for perfect foresight) is a sequence of temporary equilibria that satisfies for all $t\u0026gt;0$ the equation:\n$$k_{t+1} =\\frac{1}{1+n}s \\left( \\omega(k_{t}), f^{\\prime}(k_{t+1}) \\right).$$\nNote: de la Croix and Michel discuss on pp. 20–27 the existence and uniqueness of the intertemporal equilibrium.\nExistence of an intertemporal equilibrium The existence of at least one temporary equilibrium is guaranteed by the properties of the functions. The proof is quite involved, though, as is presented below. Having an intertemporal equilibrium means having a solution for $k_{t+1}$ in the equation\n$$k_{t+1} = \\frac{1}{1+n}s(\\omega(k_t), f^\\prime (k_{t+1})),$$\nwhere $k_t$ is predetermined at $t.$\nProof The proof uses the following equation about savings: $$0\u0026lt; s\\left( w, f^\\prime(k) \\right) \u0026lt; w.$$ In words, it indicates that individuals have positive savings, and they save only part of their total income.\nNext, define $$H(k,w) = (1+n)k - s(w, f^\\prime(k))= 0.$$ Basically, here we are using the definition of an intertemporal equilibrium. Having an intertemporal equilibrium is then equivalent to finding a $k$ satisfying the previous equation.\nWe use the intermediate value theorem to show that at least one solution exists. First, we analyse the behaviour of $H(k,w)$ when $k$ tends to $+\\infty.$\nFrom $0\u0026lt; s\\left( w, f^\\prime(k) \\right) \u0026lt; w,$ we have\n$$0 \u0026lt; \\frac{s(w, f^\\prime (k))}{k} \u0026lt; \\frac{w}{k}.$$\nLimit when $k \\rightarrow …","date":1562803200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562803200,"objectID":"c5c26f7dca1bbae9889ef50d92a7c4c2","permalink":"https://example.com/courses/macroeconomics/olg/olg_equilibrium/","publishdate":"2019-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/macroeconomics/olg/olg_equilibrium/","section":"courses","summary":"Temporary equilibrium Before turning to the intertemporal equilibrium and the analysis of the steady state, we study the temporary equilibrium that takes place every period.\nWe have not discussed the firms, but they follow the same setup as in Ramsey: use capital and labour in a perfectly competitive environment.","tags":null,"title":"Intertemporal equilibrium","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"L’hypothèse de Jared Diamond (1997): Guns, Germs and Steel Selon Jared Diamond (1997), derrière les inégalités entre pays on trouve certains facteurs qui se sont déclenchés pendant la révolution Néolithique, c’est-à-dire, à partir de l’adoption de l’agriculture. Or, pour comprendre pourquoi y a-t-il des régions développées et en développement, il faut connaître pourquoi l’agriculture est apparue et adoptée dans certaines régions du monde tandis qu’autres ont continué à obtenir leurs calories parmi la chasse et la récollection des fruits.\nChasseurs cueilleurs vs agriculture Aujourd’hui, quelques groupes ethniques continuent à vivre comme les chasseurs cueilleurs. Ces populations montrent très peu de différences entre habitants: ils reçoivent plus ou moins la même quantité de nourriture et ils participent aux différentes activités. Notamment, c’est qui est important est la manque d’un groupe de personnes complètement détachés des activités liées à la production (de nourriture).\nOpposé à cette situation, on trouve les sociétés agricoles. C’est que distingue les unes des autres est la productivité du travail: avec la maîtrise de l’agriculture, la productivité marginale du travail (en termes de calories) augmente, c’est qui permet qu’une partie de la population soit détachée de l’agriculture. Ainsi, les sociétés agricoles produissent les calories nécessaires pour la survie de toute la population avec moins de fermiers. La plus grande productivité leur permet de générer un surplus qu’est utilisé pour nourrir aux non fermiers: les bureaucrates, prêtres, savants, penseurs, etc. À noter que les activités des non-fermiers sont de nature mentale. L’exercice de ces activités facilite l’invention de l’écriture, la pensée scientifique (mathématique, géométrie, astronomie, etc.) et le développement technologique. Enfin, comme le passage vers l’agriculture a lieu en époque Malthusienne, il est possible d’argumenter que les premières sociétés à l’adopter ont un avantage car ces sociétés accumuleront technologie davantage, produiront plus et augmenteront la population, fait que renforce le développement technologique en un cercle vertueux.\nL’apparition de l’agriculture Selon les données archéologiques, l’agriculture a apparu en multiples occasions à travers le monde avec une variation temporelle. Après chaque invention originale, elle s’est rependue aux alentours. Les premières traces d’agriculture (Price et Bar-Yousef (2011)) apparaissent au croissant fertile (10 000 BP) et en Amérique centrale (10 000 - 8 000 BP), en Chine (8 000 BP), en Amérique du Sud (8 000 BP - 6 000 BP), Nouvelle Guinée (7 000 BP), Inde, Amérique du Nord et Afrique équatoriale (4 000 BP - 2 000 BP).1 Ensuite, l’agriculture s’est rependu aux régions limitrophes des zones originales. La dispersion de l’agriculture depuis les zones originales n’était pas homogène et dépendait de facteurs géographiques.\nClimat favorable similaire à l’original. Un climat proche ã celui des zones de première agriculture assure que les plantes poussent, et donc, il est plus probable que l’agriculture soit adopté de manière préférentielle en zones qui partagent un climat similaire. Le climat est similaire le long d’une même latitude. Pour tant, il est plus facile que l’agriculture se répand dans un continent avec orientation est ouest que dans un continent à orientation nord sud. Par exemple, le riz africain aurait pu se cultiver dans le climat méditerranéen de l’Afrique du Sud. Mais une vaste zone tropicale sépare le Nord du Sud de l’Afrique, avec un climat complètement différent et inhospitalier pour le riz. C’est pareil pour le tournesol, native d’Amérique du Nord et qui aurait pu être cultivé en région Andine. Malheureusement, entre les deux il y a toute une gamme de climats différents qui rend plus difficile son expansion. Barrières physiques: Les sèment ne se répandissent pas automatiquement: il faut les transporter. Un facteur qui facilite l’expansion de l’agriculture sur le plan géographique est la possibilité de franchir grandes distances de manière facile. C’est le cas, par exemple, en Europe continentale et l’est de l’Asie, avec des grandes plaines. Par contre, en Californie, l’agriculture a pris du temps à se développer, ce qui peut paraitre étonnant car en même latitude mais à l’est du continent, ou moins quatre plates ont été domestiqués 4 000 BP. Mais, le centre les États-Unis est une région sèche, avec des déserts et grandes chaînes de montagnes, qui font plus difficile la transmission de l’agriculture. Les effets d’une agriculture précoce Densité de population, technologie et revenu Selon le modèle unifié de croissance économique (et selon Diamond), les régions qui ont adopté en premier l’agriculture ont eu un avantage sur les autres. Ainsi, la productivité additionnelle due à l’agriculture aurait permis deux choses:\nAugmenter la population: on devrait observer une plus grande densité de population en zones agricoles.

Pour tant, les pays qui, pour une raison ou une autre, sont entrés plus tôt dans l’époque moderne, jouissent d’un avantage comparatif grâce ã une plus intense accumulation de capital humain. Enfin, toute raison qu’incite à investir dans l’éducation générera une disparité économique. Et, au sens contraire, les raison retardant le trade-off génèrent un retard économique, car elles préviennent l’accéleration de la croissance technologique et, pour tant, économique.\nAndersen, Dalgaard et Selaya (2016) proposent d’étudier les maladies comme une raison retardante du quality-quality trade-off.\nRendement de l’éducation, cataractes et croissance économique L’investissement dans l’éducation est, après tout, comment n’importe quel autre investissement et ce que le détermine est le rendement espéré. Or, le rendement depend, entre autres choses, du temps pendant lequel l’inversion est productive. Pour l’éducation, la dimension temporelle de l’investissement est liée à l’espérance de vie et à certaines maladies qui déprécient sa valeur. L’article d’Anderset et al. se porte sur les maladies oculaires, et en particulier, sur les cataractes. Généralement, on associe les cataractes à un âge avancé, et donc, elles sembleront ne pas influir sur le rendement de l’éducation car elles se manifestent à la fin de la vie. Par contre, études ophtalmologiques montrent qu’on peut perdre jusqu’à 14 ans de travail à cause des cataractes.\nFinalement, les auteurs s’appuient sur le fait que l’exposition au rayonnement ultraviolet (UV) augmente la probabilité de souffrir cataractes. Ce type de rayonnement est beaucoup plus intense proche de l’équateur.\nPrédictions et validation Andersen, Dalgaard et Selaya (2016) prédisent que l’exposition au UV affecte:\nLa transition démographique: Dans les régions avec plus de rayonnement UV, le rendement de l’éducation est inférieur à cause des cataractes.1 Pour tant: Le UV devrait être corrélé avec l’année de la transition de fertilité, L’effet du UV devrait être nul en époque Malthusienne car personne n’investissait pas en éducation, Le UV devrait être corrélé avec le niveau d’activité économique en époque moderne, Le UV devrait être corrélé avec l’investissement en éducation. Les auteurs utilisent données de Reher (2004) pour calculer l’année de la transition de fertilité pour chaque pays. Rappelons que le rayonnement UV diminue le rendement de l’investissement en éducation et, pour tant, retarde la réduction de fertilité. Ainsi, le rayonnement UV devrait être positivement corrélé avec l’année de transition. Ensuite (Colonne 6) comment, en effet, une transition de fertilité plus tardive est associée avec moins de revenu per capita pendant l’année 2004. La deuxième prédiction est aussi vérifiée: en époque Malthusienne, le rayonnement ultraviolet n’avait pas d’effet sur la densité de population.2 Par contre, en époque moderne la relation est telle que prévue: plus de rayonnement UV est associé avec une diminution du revenu per capita. Enfin, les auteurs valident leur hypothèse à propos du lien entre le rayonnement UV et l’éducation. Ainsi, vu que dans les régions qui plus rayonnées la valeur du capital humain et l’éducation sont inférieurs, le niveau éducatif devrait être aussi inférieur. L’exposition au rayonnement UV augmente aussi la probabilité de souffrir certains types de cancer. Néanmoins, les auteurs considèrent que les adaptations génétiques (pigmentation de la peau, par exemple) neutralisent l’effet sur les investissements en éducation. ↩︎\nIl faut se rappeler qu’en époque Malthusienne, la densité de population est la variable qui explique le niveau de développement; et non le revenu per capita. ↩︎\n","date":1562803200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562803200,"objectID":"ddfb9a83dcd2bac46156f54b95b98d8d","permalink":"https://example.com/courses/macroeconomics/comparative_development/papers/andersen_dalgaard_selaya__2016/","publishdate":"2019-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/macroeconomics/comparative_development/papers/andersen_dalgaard_selaya__2016/","section":"courses","summary":"Maladies et développement: Andersen, Dalgaard et Selaya (2016) Un des traits fondamentaux qui détermine le passage de l’époque post-Malthusienne à l’époque moderne est l’apparition du “quality-quantity trade-off”, c’est-à-dire, le fait que les familles décident d’avoir moins d’enfants mais d’investir dans leur éducation, avec des conséquences pour l’amélioration de la technologie.","tags":null,"title":"Maladies et developpement","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Steady states A steady state of an N-dimensional dynamic system is a configuration of the system variables such that the system remains unchanged over time.

Hence, if the system is given by:\n$$\\left. \\begin{eqnarray} x^{1}_{t+1} \u0026amp; = f_{1}(x^{1}_{t}, \\ldots, x^{N}_{t}) \\\\\\ \\vdots \u0026amp; \\\\\\ x^{N}_{t+1} \u0026amp; = f_{N}(x^{1}_{t}, \\ldots, x^{N}_{t}) \\end{eqnarray} \\right\\}$$\nin a steady state we have that\n$$\\left. \\begin{eqnarray} x^{1}_{t+1} \u0026amp; = x^{1}_{t} \\\\\\ \\vdots \u0026amp; \\\\\\ x^{N}_{t+1} \u0026amp; = x^{N}_{t}. \\end{eqnarray} \\right\\}$$\nIn many cases, a steady state is only reached at the limit when $t \\rightarrow +\\infty,$ unless we intentionally start the dynamics exactly at the steady state. Moreover, the steady state is often approached asymptotically: it is never fully reached, but we get infinitesimally close to it. Finally, steady states can be (asymptotically) stable or unstable. In the first sort, variables approach the steady-state level. In the second, the system diverges from the steady state.\nThe steady state in the Ramsey model In our case, denote by $(\\bar{k}, \\bar{c}) \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{2}$ the capital and consumption levels at the steady state. Then, a steady-state solution satisfies the following system of equations:\n$$\\left. \\begin{eqnarray} u^{\\prime}(\\bar{c}) \u0026amp; = \\beta (f^{\\prime}(\\bar{k}) + 1 -\\delta) u^{\\prime}(\\bar{c}), \\\\\\ \\bar{k} \u0026amp; = f(\\bar{k}) + (1-\\delta) \\bar{k} - \\bar{c}. \\end{eqnarray} \\right\\} \\tag{9, Steady St.} \\label{eq:ss}$$\nSimplifying we can obtain the following, equivalent expression:\n$$\\left. \\begin{eqnarray} f^{\\prime}(\\bar{k}) = \\frac{\\theta}{\\beta}, \\\\\\ \\bar{c} = f(\\bar{k}) - \\delta \\bar{k}, \\end{eqnarray} \\right\\} \\tag{9.1, Steady St.} \\label{eq:ss2}$$\nwhere $\\theta \\equiv 1 - \\beta(1-\\delta) \\in (0,1).$\nExistence of the steady state From the Inada conditions for the production (Assumption R3.6) function we have that\n$$0 = \\lim_{k \\rightarrow +\\infty} f^{\\prime}(k) \u0026lt; \\frac{\\theta}{\\beta} \u0026lt; \\lim_{k \\rightarrow 0}f^{\\prime}(k) = +\\infty.$$\nHence, $f^\\prime (k)$ takes values on the interval $(0, +\\infty).$ Since the function $f^\\prime$ is continuous, by the intermediate value theorem there exists at least one $k=\\bar{k}$ such that $f^\\prime{\\bar{k}} = \\frac{\\theta}{\\beta}.$\nMoreover, from Assumption R3.4 the function $f^\\prime (k)$ is monotonically decreasing. Therefore, there exists one and only one value $\\bar{k} \\in (0,+\\infty)$ that solves the first equation in \\ref{eq:ss2}. Also, the second equation in \\ref{eq:ss2} uniquely determines the level of consumption given capital. Hence, the steady-state consumption level $\\bar{c}$ is unique.\nWe can obtain an overview of the dynamics of the model using the phase diagram and derive the exact solution using the method outlined in trajectory.\nStability of the steady state We are now interested in determining the behaviour of the economy when it starts with some level of capital $k_0$ and consumption $c_0.$ The economy is represented by a $2 \\times 2$ system of first-order difference equations. The stability of a steady state depends on the Jacobian matrix’s eigenvalues evaluated at the steady state. Note: the Appendix discusses this in more detail. In particular, we wonder whether the dynamics are such that they converge towards the steady state or diverge away from it.\nThe equations that govern the economy are the Euler equation and the law for capital accumulation:\n$$\\left. \\begin{eqnarray} u^{\\prime}(c_{t}) = \\beta (f^{\\prime}(k_{t+1}) + 1 - \\delta) u^{\\prime}(c_{t+1}), \\\\\\ k_{t+1} = f(k_{t}) + (1-\\delta) k_{t} - c_{t} \\end{eqnarray} \\right\\}. \\tag{8.1 Equilibrium} $$\nThe stability of the steady state first requires computing the Jacobian matrix. The Jacobian matrix associated to the system is:\n$$\\bar{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial c_{t+1}}{\\partial c_{t}} \u0026amp; \\frac{\\partial c_{t+1}}{\\partial k_{t}} \\\\\\ \\frac{\\partial k_{t+1}}{\\partial c_{t}} \u0026amp; \\frac{\\partial k_{t+1}}{\\partial k_{t}} \\end{pmatrix}.$$\nNotice that $\\bar{A}$ represents the approximate linear behaviour of the economy at any given point: $\\begin{pmatrix}c_{t+1} \\\\\\ k_{t+1}\\end{pmatrix} \\approx \\begin{pmatrix} c_0 \\\\\\ k_0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\bar{A} \\begin{pmatrix} c_t - c_0 \\\\\\ k_t - k_0 \\end{pmatrix}.$\nIn our case, the Jacobian matrix reads:\n$$\\bar{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{u^{\\prime \\prime}(c_{t})+\\beta f^{\\prime \\prime}(k_{t+1})u^{\\prime}(c_{t+1})}{\\beta \\left[ f^{\\prime}(k_{t+1}) + 1 - \\delta \\right] u^{\\prime \\prime}(c_{t+1})} \u0026amp; -\\frac{\\beta f^{\\prime \\prime}(k_{t+1}) \\left[ f^{\\prime}(k_{t}) + 1 - \\delta \\right] u^{\\prime}(c_{t+1})}{\\beta \\left[ f^{\\prime}(k_{t+1}) + 1 - \\delta \\right] u^{\\prime \\prime}(c_{t+1})} \\\\\\ -1 \u0026amp; f^{\\prime}(k_{t}) + 1 - \\delta \\end{pmatrix}. \\tag{10, Jacobian} \\label{eq:jacobian}$$\nThen, we evaluate \\ref{eq:jacobian} at the steady state.

En particulier, la croissance technologique, active depuis toujours, permet le changement d’époque. Pour tant, comprendre les sources qui permettent l’avancement technologique aide a mieux comprendre les différences et les inégalités en termes de revenu per capita qu’on observe aujourd’hui. Dès nos jours, il est raisonnable de penser que la technologie se répand depuis la “frontière technologique” vers des tiers pays grâce, en part, au commerce.1 Pour tant, en principe, les régions plus proches de cette frontière auront un avantage car il est plus facile et moins couteux d’imiter ce qui est crée en frontière. De même, il prends moins de temps pour qu’une technologie arrive à un endroit proche de la frontière, et donc, il on va l’adapter avant.\nLe papier d’Özak (2018) remporte ces considérations à l’époque Malthusienne. De manière surprenante, il montre comment dans cette époque, le rôl de la distance à la frontière technologique était assez différent. Vu que le commerce importait moins à l’époque, Özak propose que la distance à la frontière aura un effet en forme de U sur le développement. Ainsi, les régions proches à la frontière reçoivent les nouvelles technologies rapidement; comme aujourd’hui. Par contre, il indique qu’en les régions lointaines est nécessaire un processus d’adaptation technologique: il faut du temps et de la pensée pour adapter les nouvelles technologies à un environment qui ne ressemble pas à ce d’origine. Ainsi, en régions lointaines, les gens se spécialisent à penser et adapter la technologie. Même, il est parfois possible que les nouvelles technologies n’arrivent jamais ou que les adaptations soient impossible si l’environnement est très différent ou la distance trop large. Dans ce cas, on espère que les régions lointaines soient inventives et créent leur propre technologie. Enfin, Özak considére que loin de la frontière une culture qui valorise la créativité émerge. Selon cette vision, les zones à une distance vers la frontière moyen seront les plus défavorisés: elles ne reçoivent pas beaucoup de technologie, mais elles ne n’adaptent ni en créent non plus.\nDiffusion technologique Si on pense à l’époque Malthusienne, la transmission des connaissances techniques impliquait le déplacement de gens qui savaient opérer la technologie ou la produire.2 Par contre, le transport physique des engins et machines ne semble pas avoir eu de l’importance si on considére que le taille du commerce était inférieure. C’est-à-dire, quand on voulait imiter une nouvelle technologie, on cherchait quelqu’un qui avait déjà travaillé avec la technologie.\nLes créateurs d’instruments de précision sont arrivés au Royaume-Uni depuis l’Allemagne. Humfray Cole, créateur anglais, était apprenti de Thomas Gemini, habitant à Louvain en Belgique, et lui avait étudié en Allemagne. Fibonacci apprenait l’algèbre des Arabes pendant les voyages de son père, et ensuite l’introduisait en Europe. La plupart d’essais pour produire de la porcelaine en Europe furent inutiles, à exception faite d’une technique développé en Saxe et gardé sécrète. Il fallait qu’un prêtre Jésuite français copiait la recette à l’aide des catholiques chinois. Le monopole dans la production des miroirs de haute qualité qu’avait Murano ne finissait jusqu’à le roi français Louis XIV embauchait un producteur de Murano. En représailles, le syndicat des miroirs de Murano emprisonnait les familles de producteurs qui avait dévoilé leur secret. Pour tant, le plus loin qu’on était de la frontière technologique, le plus difficile il est de recevoir une nouvelle technologie de manière directe. En plus, quand une nouvelle technologie arrive, il est fort probable qu’elle nécessite un processus d’adaptation à l’environnement local: par exemple, avec un climat assez différent une copie directe serait inutile. C’est le cas avec les cathédrales gothiques: l’implémentation exacte change d’une région à l’autre. De plus, il est tout à fait possible qu’il soit moins couteaux de créer des innovations plutôt que d’adapter une technologie. Par exemple, l’agriculture, la boussole et le nombre zéro ont été inventés à plusieurs reprises. De manière résumée, Özak propose que ces deux effets conduisent à une plus grande créativité dans les régions qui sont loin de la frontière technologique. Ainsi, ces zones deviendront des clusters d’innovation et adaptation.\nPrédiction et validation En premier lieu, Özak construit une nouvelle mesure de distance à la frontière technologique basée sur l’idée de la distance géographique et la difficulté pour traverser un terrain. Ainsi, les régions qui sont plates sont faciles à traverser, les montagnes ajoutent de la difficulté, les terrains verglacés ou marécageux demandent plus de temps à les croiser, etc. Ensuite, il faut connaître où se trouve la frontière technologique et il est important de remarquer que …","date":1562803200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562803200,"objectID":"6187fc6cec02543ee10b0a4386abf3f1","permalink":"https://example.com/courses/macroeconomics/comparative_development/papers/ozak__2018/","publishdate":"2019-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/macroeconomics/comparative_development/papers/ozak__2018/","section":"courses","summary":"Transmission de la technologie et innovation (Özak, 2018) Dans le modèle de croissance unifiée, le rôle de la technologie est primordial.

As with tariffs, export subsidies can be ad-valorem or specific, although this distinction is not important in the analysis. First, we shall note that, differently from before, in this case we shall assume that Home exports a good, this is, the autarky price at Home is lower than the international price.\nEffects of an export subsidy When a countri subsidizes its exports, the domestic price of the product increases. This is because now, a local producer can sell it a Home at the world price $p^w$, or ship it abroad and gain the world price plus the subsidy: $p^w + s$. At the same time, the subsidy encourages more local produces to start producing, world supply for the good increases and the world price goes down (here we just focus on the case where the country is large enough to meaningfuly affect world supply). Thus, as with the tariff, the change in prices implied by the subsidy is shared between consumers at Home, who pay a higher price, and consumers abroad who enjoy a lower price; firms earn the subsidy and the government has to pay for it. However, different from before, we can show that the net effect of an export subsidy is negative: Thus, the effects of an export subsidy are:\nReduce the price in foreign markets, hurting the terms of trade, Increases the domestic price, Represents a fiscal cost. A question arises: if export subsidies hurt the exporting country that implements them, why do they exist? The answer is “political economy”. Typically, export subsidies benefit a relatively small but very well organised group of people, for instance, European farmers.\nLast, usually, to avoid re-imports of the goods just exported, an equivalent import tariff is levied. Otherwise, an exporter could export the good and touch the subsidy, immediately import it and re-export it again to gain again the subsidy, etc. Tariffs prevent this from happening.\n","date":1562803200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562803200,"objectID":"461bf48e9a05b1de89751d5c3f7ad21f","permalink":"https://example.com/courses/international_trade/export_subsidies/","publishdate":"2019-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/international_trade/export_subsidies/","section":"courses","summary":"Export subsidies","tags":null,"title":"Export subsidies","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Here we analyse the behaviour of the savings function when utility is non-separable.

However, it is unstable.\nOther steady state The economy can also present interior steady states with $\\bar{k}\u0026gt;0.$ Unlike the Ramsey model, here we can have stable and unstable steady states, as we shall see. Moreover, the configuration varies depending on the production and utility functions.\nStability of the steady state This model can feature one or several steady states. This depends on the characteristics of the production and utility functions.\nFirst, the dynamics of $k$ are monotonic: either continuously increase or decrease. This follows from assuming a unique intertemporal equilibrium, see also. This extra assumption also implies that the intermporal elasticity of substitution is not too small. In particular, we operationalise (p. 25 in de la Croix and Michel.) it as:\n$$\\forall c\u0026gt;0, \\quad u^\\prime( c ) + c u^{\\prime \\prime}( c ) \\geq 0 \\Leftrightarrow \\sigma( c ) \\geq 1.$$\nDue to the fact the monotonicity of the dynamics, capital can converge either to $0,, \\bar{k}\\in (0,+\\infty),, $ or $+\\infty.$\nThe economy never goes to $k = +\\infty$ This is equivalent to saying that starting with a a high level of capital $k_{0}$, the dynamics imply $k_{t+1} \u0026lt; k_{t}.$\nFirst, we have that:\n$$g(k) = \\frac{1}{1+n}s(\\omega(k),f^\\prime(\\underbrace{g(k)}_{k_{t+1}}))\u0026lt;\\frac{\\omega(k)}{1+n}.$$ This holds because savings $s$ are always a fraction of wages $\\omega.$\nSecond, we show that:\n$$\\lim_{k \\rightarrow +\\infty}\\frac{g(k)}{k} = 0.$$\nTo see the intuition for this limit, assume for a moment it holds. Then, it must be that for large enough $k,, g(k) = k_{t+1} \u0026lt; k_{t}$ and the dynamics are decreasing and converge to some $\\bar{k}.$ In this case, $\\bar{k}$ is the largest steady state, and because the dynamics are monotonic, the economy never goes to the other side of the steady state.\nWe show next that $\\lim_{k \\rightarrow +\\infty}\\frac{g(k)}{k} = 0.$ We do so by showing that $\\lim_{k \\rightarrow +\\infty} \\color{green}{\\frac{\\omega(k)}{k}} = 0.$\nDetailed explanation We start by noting that: $$\\color{green}{\\frac{\\omega(k)}{k}} = \\color{red}{\\frac{f(k)}{k}} - \\color{blue}{f^\\prime (k)} \\leftarrow \\omega(k) = f(k) - f^\\prime (k) k.$$\nWhen $k \\rightarrow +\\infty$, the first term $\\color{red}{\\frac{f(k)}{k}}$ admits a positive limit, let’s call it $\\mathcal{l}_{1}.$ This is because:\n$\\color{red}{\\frac{f(k)}{k}} \u0026gt; 0.$ $\\color{red}{\\frac{f(k)}{k}}$ is decreasing: $$\\frac{\\partial \\color{red}{\\frac{f(k)}{k}}}{\\partial k} = \\frac{f^\\prime(k)k-f(k)}{k^{2}} = - \\frac{f(k) - f^\\prime (k) k}{k^{2}} = - \\frac{\\omega(k)}{k^{2}} \u0026lt; 0.$$ The second term $\\color{blue}{f^\\prime (k)}$ is decreasing and positive, thus it admits a limit $\\mathcal{l}_{2}$ when $k \\rightarrow +\\infty.$\nApply the mean value theorem evaluated at $k$ and $2k$:1\n$$f(2k) - f(k) = (2k-k)f^\\prime(k(1+\\theta)), \\quad \\mathrm{with}, \\theta \\in (0,1).$$ Then, $$\\frac{2f(2k)}{2k} - \\frac{f(k)}{k} = f^\\prime(k(1+\\theta))$$ Taking the limit when $k \\rightarrow +\\infty$ we …","date":1562803200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562803200,"objectID":"c12592e08b0d0722d1a5aa424d38cc91","permalink":"https://example.com/courses/macroeconomics/olg/olg_steady_state/","publishdate":"2019-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/macroeconomics/olg/olg_steady_state/","section":"courses","summary":"We assume that the intertemporal equilibrium exists and is unique.

Similarly, we have the $k$-locus.\nThese loci are curves on the $(c,k)$ plane, and any intersection between them is a steady state because both $c$ and $k$ are simultaneously constant. The phase diagram is a useful tool to analyse the behaviour of a dynamic system because it indicates the direction of movement of the variables at any point on the plane.\nThe dynamics of $c$ The first equation of \\ref{eq:eq} describes the dynamics of consumption.\n$$u^{\\prime}(c_{t}) = \\beta ( f^{\\prime}(k_{t+1}) + 1 - \\delta) u^{\\prime}(c_{t+1}).$$\nRearranging it we arrive at:\n$$\\frac{u^{\\prime}(c_{t})}{u^{\\prime}(c_{t+1})} = \\beta ( f^{\\prime}(k_{t+1}) + 1 - \\delta).$$\nIn the phase diagram we want to plot combinations of $(c,k)$ such that $c$ is constant. Constant consumption implies $c_t = c_{t+1} \\implies \\frac{u^\\prime (c_t)}{u^\\prime (c_{t+1})} = 1.$ Therefore, the $c$-locus is\n$$ 1 = \\beta ( f^{\\prime}(k_{t+1}) + 1 - \\delta)$$\nand any level of capital satisfying it implies constant consumption. This condition depends only on the level of capital.\nDenote such level $k^{\\star}$. When $k \u0026lt; k^{\\star}, f^{\\prime}(k) \u0026gt; f^{\\prime}(k^{\\star})$, implying that $u^{\\prime}(c_{t}) \u0026gt; u^{\\prime}(c_{t+1})$ and hence consumption will raise over time. Similarly, if $k \u0026gt; k^{\\star}$ implies that consumption falls. Note: remember that we are looking at $f^{\\prime}(k)$ and $u^{\\prime}(c)$, not $k$ and $c.$ This information is summarised in the following Figure.\nThe arrows show the direction in which consumption $c$ evolves. As discussed before, consumption raises when capital is below $k^{\\star}$ and raises when above. Note the vertical line: it denotes the level of capital $k^{\\star}$ such that $c$ is constant. The value $k^{\\star}$ can be easily computed: $k^{\\star} = {f^{\\prime}}^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1-\\beta (1-\\delta)}{\\beta}\\right).$\nThe dynamics of $k$ We can proceed similarly with the motion of capital. The relevant equation in this case is:\n$$k_{t+1} = f(k_{t}) + (1- \\delta)k_{t} - c_{t}.$$\nAs before, we are interested in the combinations of $(k,c)$ such that capital remains constant over time. In this case, though, and contrasting with the previous, we will obtain that both capital and consumption affect capital levels in the future: production uses current capital, and current consumption depletes current production. We can rearrange the previous equation to obtain the following:\n$$k_{t+1} - k_{t} = f(k_{t}) - \\delta k_{t} - c_{t}.$$ Setting $k_{t+1} = k_{t} \\implies k_{t+1} - k_{t} = 0$ so capital is constant yields:\n$$ 0 = f(k_{t}) - \\delta k_{t} - c_{t} \\implies c_{t} = f(k_{t}) - \\delta k_{t}.$$\nIn the $(k,c)$ space, the equation takes a form similar to a parabola: it combines production —with decreasing marginal returns— with a linear depreciation rate. In fact, f(k_t)-\\delta k_t$ admits one maximum $(f^\\prime (k_t) = \\delta)$ the Golden rule we discuss later. Since $f^{\\prime \\prime}(k_t)\u0026lt;0,$ the stationary point is a maximum.\nLet’s now analyse how capital evolves when consumption is above and below the level that makes it constant. From $k_{t+1} - k_{t} = f(k_{t}) - \\delta k_{t} - c_{t}$, if consumption is above the level we have that $k_{t+1} - k_{t} \u0026lt; 0,$ meaning that capital decreases over time. The opposite applies when consumption is below the level that guarantees a constant level of capital. The Figure below summarises these findings:\nThe phase diagram We can combine the information above to produce the phase diagram. It indicates the motion of variables at different points of the $(k,c)$ space.\nThe arrows show the motion of each variable at different combinations of $(k,c).$ For instance, to the left of the $c$-locus and above the $k0$-locus consumption increases and capital decreases. Finally, the point indicating the intersection of both curves is the steady state: all variables remain constant at their values.\n","date":1562803200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562803200,"objectID":"fe4d3f999c2595d1d8614a0c92da33c7","permalink":"https://example.com/courses/macroeconomics/ramsey/ramsey_phase_diagram/","publishdate":"2019-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/macroeconomics/ramsey/ramsey_phase_diagram/","section":"courses","summary":"Note: based on Section 2.3 of Romer, Advanced Macroeconomics.\nThe Ramsey model is fully described by two dynamic equations:\n$$\\left. \\begin{eqnarray} u^{\\prime}(c_{t}) = \\beta(f^{\\prime}(k_{t+1}) + 1 - \\delta)u^{\\prime}(c_{t+1}), \\\\\\ k_{t+1} = f(k_{t} + (1-\\delta)k_{t} - c_{t}.","tags":null,"title":"The phase diagram","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Diversité génétique et développement (Ashraf et Galor, 2013) Le papier d’Ashraf et Galor (2013) propose l’idée qu’au sein des sociétés, les différences entre individus peuvent être une source de richesse ou entraîner des coûts économiques.

En général, permet plus d’innovation et pusse la frontière productive. Par contre, une société dans laquelle les membres sont très différents pose aussi certains coûts:\nLa coordination est plus difficile, car on peut avoir préférences différentes, Le conflit est plus probable, Le confiance vers les autres est inférieure. Ainsi, vu les coûts et les bénéfices, il est fort probable que la relation entre diversité et croissance économique aie forme de U inversé. C’est-à-dire, si tous les gens sont égaux, on ne profite pas des avantages liés à la diversité. Et au contraire, si les différences entre gens sont maximales, les coûts surpassent énormément les bénéfices. Alors, il semble qu’un niveau optimal de diversité peut exister.1\nUne mesure de diversité entre personnes : diversité génétique L’hypothèse de base de ce article est que la migration humain depuis l’Afrique il y a 70000-90000 ans a affecté la diversité génétique et, donc, si ce que les autors proposent est correct, aura affecté de manière indirecte le développement économique. Alors, Ashraf et Galor s’appuient sur des recherches en athropologie et en génétique pour avoir une mesure de la diversité génétique entre personnes au sein d’un pays. On part de l’effet fondateur, c’est-à-dire, le fait que, quand on scinde un petite population, la diversité génétique du noveau groupe ainsi crée est inférieure à celle du groupe d’origine. On peut appliquer ce concept à la migration humaine depuis l’Afrique. De cette manière, à mesure que les hommes conquirent des nouvelles endroits (Europe, Asie, îlles du sud-est de l’Asie, Amérique du Nord et du Sud, etc), la diversité génétique diminuira. Bien compris, ce qui est important est la distance migratoire par terre. Un indice qui mésure la diversité génétique est le taux d’hétérozigosité : la probabilité que deux personnes tirées au hasard partagent certaines gens. Ces donnés existent pour 53 groupes humains qui ont vécu plus oi moins isolés et au même endroit pour très longue temps. En effet, on voit qu’il existe une corrélation négative entre la distance à Addis Ababa et quelques indicateurs de diversité, y compris l’hétérozigosité. Résultats D’abord, Ashraf et Galor utilisent un enchantillon de 21 pays pour lesquels une mesure directe du niveau d’hétérozigosité existe. Même avec une taille si reduite, on voit une relation en forme de U inversé entre le niveau de diversité génétique et le développement économique pendant l’année 1500. Il est important de rappeler que, vu que les régressions se concentrent en l’èpoque Malthusienne, la variable qui mesure correctement le niveau de développement est la densité de population et non le revenu per capita. Or, on peut constater que l’hypothèse de Jared Diamond est aussi vérifiée : les pays qui ont adopté l’agriculture plus tôt se sont plus développés.\nEnsuite, les auteurs enlargisent leur enchantillon utilisant le fait que la distance migratoire à Addis Ababa est éxogene et permet de predire, avec précision, le niveau de diversité génétique. En plus, les auteurs montrent que cette relation existe aussi pour le présent, cette fois ci, utilisant le niveau de revenu per capita en l’année 2000. On voit que le niveau optimal de diversité génétique change avec le temps : en 1500 il était de 0.68 et en 2000 il est de 0.71. Ainsi, avec le progrès technologique, une plus grand diversité entre les gens est nécéssaire pour la croissance économique : par example, le dégré d’spécialisation productive est supérieur aujourd’hui. Ces niveau corréspondent au Japon en 1500 et aux États-Unis en 2000.\nMéchanismes Enfin, plusieurs auteurs ont pris le relais et se sont concéntrés sur les méchanismes qui pourraient être derriére la relation entre diversité génétique et développement. En premier lieu, Ashraf et Galor montrent de l’evidence qui mets en relation la diversité génétique avec le niveau de confiance (un des coûts de la diversité) et la production scientifique. Ainsi, si les hypothèses étaient correctes, on s’attend à ce que les pays avec une plus grande diversité génétique montrent de niveaux moins inférieures de confiance vers les tiers personnes et qu’ils produissent davantage de recherches scientifiques. Une autre possibilité qu’on peut explorer c’est la relation entre la diversité génétique et le nombre de groups ethniques Ashraf et Galor (2013b).

Note: different from an export subsidy, here the Home country is not an exporter. The main idea behind it is to boost local production, and this instrument contributes to this end by two means:\nWith the tariff, the price at home increase, increasing local production, With the production subsidy, local production is encouraged even more. In general, liaison mechanisms are established such that the entire revenue coming from the tariff is used to pay production subsidies.\nEffects of a liaison mechanism To simplify things, we focus on a small, open economy that imports a good. The first step consists on adding a tariff on imports, we assume it is an ad-valorem tariff, though. For a small country, we already know that this represents a deadweight loss, and that the price payed by the consumers equals $p^w(1+\\tau)$. At this stage, the tariff levied by the government is equal to $p^w \\tau (D_\\text{tariff} - S_\\text{tariff}).$ Next, these proceedings are used to finance a production subsidy at the rate $s$, which further increases the priced received by the producers to $(p^w(1+\\tau)(1+s).$ At the same time, local production increases, which implies that less imports are required, thus reducing the amount of income the government levies. Is is possible to mathematically balance the two such that the entire amount coming from the tariff is used to finance the production subsidy. Note, however, that the introduction of the production subsidy does not change the quantity nor the price faced by the consumers. Thus, the situation is as follows:\nSince local production increases, imports decrease to $D_\\text{tariff} - S_\\text{subs}.$ Consequently, tariff revenue also decreases to $p^w \\tau (D_\\text{tariff} - S_\\text{subs}).$ The total amount payed as subsidy is $p^w(1+\\tau)s S_\\text{subs}.$ $p^w \\tau D_\\text{tariff} - S_\\text{subs} = p^w(1+\\tau)s S_\\text{subs}.$ Overall, we observe that production moved from $S_\\text{free}$ to $S_\\text{subs}$ and producers earn $p^w(1+\\tau)(1+s).$ Demand shrinks, as with all tariffs: $D_\\text{free}$ to $D_\\text{tariff}.$ The consumers loss the blue-shaded area, while producers gain the orange surface. The effect for the government is neutral: as we said, tariff income (dotted area) is equal to the subsidy (star area). So, we shall compare the following areas: Lastly, knowing that the dotted area equals the starred area, the total loss of welfare is: If we compare the situation with just a tariff, we can see that the total welfare loss is greater. This is because the production subsidy incentivizes some local producers to produce, while before their production was covered by more efficient foreign imports. So, the problem is that the subsidy miss-allocated ressources towards relatively inefficient producers.\n","date":1562803200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562803200,"objectID":"50e038a5a11e1101724724cf073db9a6","permalink":"https://example.com/courses/international_trade/liaison_mechanism/","publishdate":"2019-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/international_trade/liaison_mechanism/","section":"courses","summary":"Liaison mechanism","tags":null,"title":"Liaison mechanism","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In the OLG model, a unique intertemporal equilibrium arises if, for a given $k_t$, the equation\n$$H(k_{t+1}) = k_{t+1} - \\frac{1}{1+n}s\\left(\\omega(k_t), f^\\prime(k_{t+1})\\right) = 0$$\nhas a unique solution.

Note: This means that there is only one combination of initial capital and consumption, $(k_{0}, c_{0})$, such that the economy converges towards it. Any other initial value consumption at $t=0$ (capital is pre-determined and thus we cannot change it) has a diverging trajectory.\nWe now compute the exact behaviour of $(k_{t}, c_{t})$ around the steady state.\nThe model is highly non-linear, so we study a simpler linearised version around the steady state. First, let’s approximate the dynamics of capital and consumption around the steady state.\nThe approximation around the steady state The behaviour of the dynamical system around the steady state can be approximated using a first-order Taylor expansion around it. In that sense:\n$$\\begin{pmatrix} c_{t+1} - \\bar{c} \\\\\\ k_{t+1} - \\bar{k} \\end{pmatrix} \\approx \\bar{A} \\begin{pmatrix} c_{t} - \\bar{c} \\\\\\ k_{t} - \\bar{k} \\end{pmatrix}.$$\nNext, we solve this equation of difference equations, this is, we obtain $c_t = \\mathcal{C}(c_0, k_0, t), k_t = \\mathcal{K}(c_0, k_0, t).$\nDiagonalising the matrix: eigenvalues and eigenvectors Note: based on the notes by Benjamin Moll.\nTo simplify the notation, let $y_{t} = \\begin{pmatrix} c_{t} - \\bar{c} \\\\\\ k_{t} -\\bar{k} \\end{pmatrix}.$ Hence, our problem becomes: $$y_{t+1} = \\bar{A} y_{t}.$$\nIt $\\bar{A}$ were a diagonal matrix, the solution to the system would be straightforward. In fact, if that were the case it would have been (I change variables to avoid confusion):\n$$\\begin{pmatrix} \\phi_{t+1} \\\\ \\omega_{t+1} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a_{1,1} \u0026amp; 0 \\\\\\ 0 \u0026amp; a_{2,2} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\phi_{t} \\\\\\ \\omega_{t} \\end{pmatrix}.$$ So, it is clear that $\\phi_{t+1} = a_{1,1} \\phi_{t} \\implies \\phi_{t} = a_{1,1}^{t} \\phi_{0}$ and we would find a similar expression for $\\omega.$\n$\\bar{A}$ is not diagonal, but we can apply a spectral decomposition and obtain an equivalent system governed by a diagonal matrix. In particular, we are looking for an $2 \\times 2$ invertible matrix $X$ such that $ X^{-1} \\bar{A} X = \\Lambda$, where $\\Lambda$ is diagonal. We will then apply the following transformation to our system (pre-multiplying by $\\color{red}{X^{-1}}$ on both sides and multiplying by $\\color{green}{XX^{-1}}$ on the right-hand side). $$ \\color{red}{X^{-1}} y_{t+1} = \\color{red}{X^{-1}} \\bar{A} \\color{green}{(X X^{-1})} y_{t} = X^{-1} \\bar{A} X (X^{-1} y_{t}) =$$ $$ = \\Lambda X^{-1} y_{t}.$$\nDenote $z \\equiv X^{-1} y$. Thus, the system becomes:\n$$z_{t+1} = \\Lambda z_{t}.$$ Since $\\Lambda$ is diagonal, the solutions are of the form: $$z_{t} = \\Lambda^{t} z_{0}.$$ Note: in general, the power of a matrix is complex. However, for a diagonal matrix it is simply the power of each component.\nOnce we have the solution for the transformed system we must undo the transformation: in fact, we do not care about the evolution of $z$. This step involves using that $X^{-1} y = z \\implies y = X z$.\nThe matrix $\\Lambda$ In a spectral decomposition, the diagonal matrix $\\Lambda$ consists of the matrix whose entries are its eigenvalues. Thus (we have a $2 \\times 2$ system), $$\\Lambda = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda_{1} \u0026amp; 0 \\\\\\ 0 \u0026amp; \\lambda_{2} \\end{pmatrix}.$$\nThe matrix $X$ The matrix $X$ has as columns the eigenvectors of $\\bar{A}.$ There is one eigenvector associated with each eigenvalue. Note: it is important to correctly relate each eigenvector to its eigenvalue.\nTo find an eigenvector associated with $\\lambda_{1}$ (there are infinitely many possible eigenvectors, we only want one) we solve the following system:\n$$\\bar{A} \\begin{pmatrix} v_{1} \\\\\\ v_{2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\lambda_{1} \\begin{pmatrix} v_{1} \\\\\\ v_{2} \\end{pmatrix} \\quad \\mathrm{or} \\quad (\\bar{A} - \\lambda_{1} \\mathbb{I}) \\begin{pmatrix} v_{1} \\\\\\ v_{2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}.$$\nThe matrix $X$ then becomes:\n$$X = \\begin{pmatrix} v_{1,1} \u0026amp; v_{2,1} \\\\\\ 1 \u0026amp; 1 \\end{pmatrix}.$$\nSolving the system We begin with the solution for the transformed variable $z.$ We already know it takes the form:\n$$z_{t} = \\Lambda^{t} z_{0} \\quad \\mathrm{or} \\quad \\begin{pmatrix} z_{t}^{1} \\\\\\ z_{t}^{2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda_{1}^{t} \u0026amp; 0 \\\\\\ 0 \u0026amp; \\lambda_{2}^{t} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_{0}^{1} \\\\\\ v_{0}^{2} \\end{pmatrix}.$$\nNext, we reverse the transformation, this is, we obtain the dynamics of $y: y_{t} = X z_{t}.$ Therefore, we obtain:\n$$y_{t} = X z_{t} = X \\Lambda^{t} z_{0} = \\begin{pmatrix} v_{1,1} \u0026amp; v_{2,1} \\\\\\ v_{1,2} \u0026amp; v_{2,2} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda_{1}^{t} \u0026amp; 0 \\\\\\ 0 \u0026amp; \\lambda_{2}^{t} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} z_{0}^{1} \\\\\\ z_{0}^{2} \\end{pmatrix}.$$\nAlternatively, multiplying the matrices and recalling that $y_{t}=\\begin{pmatrix} c_{t} - \\bar{c} \\\\\\ k_{t} - \\bar{k} \\end{pmatrix}$ :\n$$\\begin{pmatrix} c_{t} - \\bar{c} \\\\\\ k_{t} - \\bar{k} \\end{pmatrix} = z_{0}^{1} \\lambda_{1}^{t} …","date":1562803200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562803200,"objectID":"ebec2beba2be4e133a4b70e59fdeee28","permalink":"https://example.com/courses/macroeconomics/ramsey/ramsey_trajectory/","publishdate":"2019-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/macroeconomics/ramsey/ramsey_trajectory/","section":"courses","summary":"The trajectory around the steady state For the moment, we have established that the model converges towards a unique steady state following a saddle path.

Therefore:\n$$ w_{t} + r_{t}k_{t} + (1-\\delta)k_{t} = c_{t} + k _{t+1}.$$\nIntertemporal utility maximisation: Lagrangian The intertemporal utility maximisation problem is:\n$$\\begin{eqnarray} \\max_{c_{t}, k_{t+1}} \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\beta^{t} u(c_{t}) \u0026amp; \\\\\\ \\mathrm{s.t.} \\quad w_{t} + r_{t} k_{t} + (1-\\delta)k_{t} = c_{t} + k_{t+1}, \\\\\\ c_{t}, k_{t+1} \u0026gt;0, k_{t=0} = k_{0} \u0026gt; 0. \\end{eqnarray} $$\nThe Lagrangian becomes:\n$$ \\mathcal{L} = \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\beta^{t} u(c_{t}) + \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\lambda_{t}(w_{t} + (r_{t} + 1 - \\delta)k_{t} - c_{t} - k_{t+1}).$$\nWe use the first-order conditions with respect to $c_{t}$ and $k_{t+1}$ to find the optimal consumption path: the Euler equation, which we combine later with the transversality condition.\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial c_{t}} = \\beta^{t} u^{\\prime}(c_{t}) - \\lambda_{t} = \\beta^{t}\\frac{1}{c_{t}} - \\lambda_{t} = 0$$ $$\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial k_{t+1}} = -\\lambda_{t} + \\lambda_{t+1} (r_{t+1} + 1 - \\delta) = 0.$$\nCombining both, we obtain the Euler equation:\n$$\\beta^{t}\\frac{1}{c_{t}} = r_{t+1} \\beta^{t+1} \\frac{1}{c_{t+1}} \\implies c_{t+1} = \\beta (r_{t} + 1 - \\delta)c_{t}.$$\nFinally, we should remember to impose the transversality condition:\n$$\\lim_{t \\rightarrow +\\infty} \\beta^{t}u^{\\prime}(c_{t})k_{t+1} = \\lim_{t \\rightarrow +\\infty}\\beta^{t}\\frac{1}{c_{t}}k_{t+1} = 0.$$\nFirm’s optimisation In this model, firms operate under perfect competition, making zero profits.

When a country implements an export tax, producers shipping a product abroad have to pay a certain amount to the government. As usual, the tax can be ad-valorem or specific. If the country that imposes an export tax is large, it will influence the world price of the good. In particular, the world price would increase, which improves the country’s terms of trade. Therefore, an export tariff can improve Home welfare (provided the country is large enough).\nEffects of an export tax When an export tax is implemented, exporting goods abroad is less profitable: now exporters must pay the tax. Consequently, less products are shipped abroad, creating an excess supply. This non-shipped production is channelled towards local consumption, which increases the local supply and pushes the local price down. The decrease in the local price benefits the consumers, but hurts producers (less exports and lower internal prices). This can be illustrated grphically as follows: As can be seen, after the introduction of the expor tax, world supply is reduced and a new equilibrium emerges. Now, foreign consumers pay the full new equilibrium price $P^\\star_S$. Local exporters gain, however, $P^\\star_S - \\tau = P_S$. Finally, since in equilibrium an exporter is indifferent between selling goods abroad (and gaining $P_S$) or selling domestically, we obtain that local consumers pay also $P_S.$ Hence, at the new equilibrium:\nThe price received by exporters decreases The price payed by local consumers decreases Consequently, exports decrease The price payed by foreign consumers increases The government collects taxes.

However, the first welfare theorem has two requisites the Diamond model does not meet: a finite number of goods and a finite number of agents. Therefore, the allocation resulting from the competitive equilibrium may not be Pareto optimal.\nThe golden-rule level of capital We begin the discussion by bringing back the idea of over- and under-accumulation of capital we have seen before. In the Diamond model —and different from the Ramsey model—, the capital stock on the balanced growth path may exceed the golden-rule level. This implies that a permanent increase in consumption is possible.\nWhen discussing the golden-rule level of capital, we are not interested in how consumption is divided between the old and the young. Rather, we seek to maximise total consumption during one period. In fact, if we maximise total consumption, the ensuing allocations between young and old will be efficient. First, let $\\mathfrak{C}_t$ represent total consumption: $$\\mathfrak{C}_t \\equiv C_t + D_t.$$ The economy-wide resource constraint dictates that total production is either consumed or invested:\n$$\\mathfrak{C}_t + K_{t+1} = F(K_t, N_t)+ (1-\\delta)K_t.$$\nAlternatively, aggregate consumption per unit of labour is:\n$$\\mathfrak{c}_t \\equiv \\frac{\\mathfrak{C}_t}{N_t} = \\frac{F(K_t, N_t) +(1-\\delta)K_t - K_{t+1}}{N_t} = f(k_t) + (1-\\delta)k_t - (1+n)k_{t+1}.$$\nThe golden-rule level of the capital-labour ratio $k^\\mathcal{GR}$ is the value of the capital-labour ratio $k$ that results in the highest possible sustainable level of consumption per unit of labour. The fact that it is sustainable requires that it is replicable forever. For this reason, we consider the steady state with $k_{t+1} = k_t = \\bar{k}$. The resource constraint at the steady state simplifies to:\n$$\\bar{\\mathfrak{c}} = f(\\bar{k})-(\\delta + n)\\bar{k} \\equiv \\mathfrak{c}(k).$$\nWe maximise this function with respect to $\\bar{k}$:\n$$\\mathfrak{c}^\\prime(\\bar{k}) = f^\\prime (\\bar{k}) - (n+\\delta) = 0$$ The fact that $\\mathfrak{c}^{\\prime \\prime}(\\bar{k}) = f^{\\prime \\prime}(\\bar{k})\u0026lt;0$ assures that we have the maximum.\nAssuming that $n+\\delta \u0026gt;0$ and that $f$ satisfies:\n$$\\lim_{k \\rightarrow +\\infty} f^\\prime(k) \u0026lt; n+ \\delta \u0026lt; \\lim_{k \\rightarrow 0} f^\\prime(k),$$\nthen $\\mathfrak{c}^\\prime(\\bar{k}) = f^\\prime (\\bar{k}) - (n+\\delta) = 0$ has a solution in $\\bar{k}$ and it is unique. Hence, the golden-rule level of capital is given by:\n$$f^\\prime(k^\\mathcal{GR}) = n + \\delta.$$\nThe highest sustainable consumption level per unit of labour is obtained when, at steady state, the net marginal productivity of capital equals the growth rate of the economy.\nOver- and under-accumulation of capital The golden-rule level of capital is given by $f^\\prime(k) = n+\\delta.$ However, in the decentralised economy, the steady-state level of savings is highly unlikely to coincide with it. For instance, a log-utility function coupled with a Cobb-Douglas production function leads to a steady-state value of capital such that $f^\\prime (k) = \\frac{\\beta}{(1+n)(1+\\beta)}^\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}.$ In general, $\\frac{\\beta}{(1+n)(1+\\beta)}^\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha} \\neq n+\\delta.$\nIf the steady-state level of the economy is such that $f^\\prime (\\bar{k}) \u0026lt; n+ \\delta,$ the economy has accumulated too much capital: if $f^\\prime (\\bar{k}) \u0026lt; f^\\prime(k^\\mathcal{GR}) \\implies \\bar{k} \u0026gt; k^\\mathcal{GR}.$ Conversely, if the interest rate at the competitive steady state is such that $f^\\prime (\\bar{k}) \u0026gt; n + \\delta,$ then it lacks capital compared to the golden rule.\nImproving the situation: dynamic inefficiency Let’s suppose for the moment that the decentralised economy reaches a situation of over-accumulation of capital, this is, $f^\\prime(\\bar{k}) \u0026lt; n + \\delta.$ It is possible to improve upon it by means of redistribution. Simply, a planner could order young individuals to save less, as to reach $k^\\mathcal{GR}.$ Doing so increases the available total output per worker, which can be consumed either by the old or the young, improving their utility. In subsequent periods, the economy would remain at $k^\\mathcal{GR}$, which maximises total output per worker.\nIn particular, assume we impose a lump-sum tax on all young individuals and we transfer it to the old generation. The transfer is fully consumed (old individuals gain utility from consuming it). Suppose the transfer is one good from each young to the old. There are $1+n$ young individuals per old individual, so the old receive $1+n$ goods. Let’s repeat this scheme every period.\nThe young transfer one good to the old Consumption of the young does not change because they refrain from saving. In the future, they receive $1+n$, which represents a return rate of $1+n$ on their “investment”. In the competitive market, they would have obtained $f^\\prime(k) \u0026lt; n + \\delta.$ Clearly, the return young individuals achieve …","date":1562803200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562803200,"objectID":"64ca613543f6c4986ee59e0ceed536cd","permalink":"https://example.com/courses/macroeconomics/olg/olg_optimality/","publishdate":"2019-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/macroeconomics/olg/olg_optimality/","section":"courses","summary":"Note: Based on de la Croix and Michel, Chapter 2 and Gorth’s lecture notes.\nThe first welfare theorem states that a competitive equilibrium is Pareto optimal.

However, governments can also influence trade by means of non-tariff barriers which do not operate on prices. The most common non-tariff barrier are quotas: a physical limit on the amont of goods that a can imported into a country. We shall analyze their effects, show that for the simplest case quotas and import tariffs are equivalent, and then show how more complex market structures affect the equivalency. Since non-tariff barriers tend to be more harmful than tariff barriers, the Uruguay round of the World Trade Organisation recommends the usage of tariff barriers instead of non-tariff barriers. Last, we shall mention some alternative non-tariff barriers that are reguarly employed.\nImport quotas An import quota limits the physical amount of goods that a country can import. In general, the government allows some local firms to import limited quantities of the good in question, which then they will resell in the local market. We focus on the simple case of small economy incapable of influencing world prices. Assuming that, when faced to international prices, Home imports a good $X$, a quota simply limits the quantity that can be imported. Therefore, the residual demand, this is, the part of Home’s demand not covered by imports will be served by local producers. Thus, if local demand is $D(p)$ and a quota $Q$ is in place, at world prices $p^w$ demand is $D(p^w)$. However, only $Q$ can be imported, and the remaining $D(p^w)-Q$ demand is served by local firms. The relevant equilibrium price $p^\\star$ equalises the residual demand with the local supply: firms that obtained the import rights have no interest in selling at a lower price. Thus, local demand is $D(p^\\star)$. Graphically: The Figure above does directly represent the total welfare loss (dashed area), where we have already subtracted the benefits that accrue to quota-holders (dotted). The main difference between a quota and tariff is that, with a tariff, the proceedings revert to the government. However, with a quota, firms that import goods cash the difference between the world price ($p^w$) and the local price ($p^\\star$).\nConsidering that, besides a redistribution from the government to quota-holders, the effects of a quota are identical to those of an import tariff, it is no surprise that both instruments are equivalent. This is, given a tariff level, we can compute a quota that will have exactly the same effects, and the reverse. Nevertheless, the analysis changes once we consider dynamics effects and imperfect competition.\nDynamic effects of a quota Suppose that, for whatever reason, local demand increases. In the presence of tariff, very little happens: the world price remains unchanged (small country hypothesis), imports increase because of the rising demand, and the government revenue increases because of higher imports. If the increase in demand is a parallel shift, welfare losses remain unchanged. In contrast, a quota limits the quantity that can imported into the country. Therefore, when demand increases, the residual demand that is left to be served by local producers increases as well: the quota remained the same. Thus, the local price increases more than before, which further reduces consumers surplus. As we can see, the additional increase in producers’ surplus does not completely compensate the harm done to consumers, and total welfare declines more than it would with a tariff. As mentioned, with the quota, the local price increases more when the demand shifts.\nSummarizing, when a small country with an import tariff experinces an expanding demand, the welfare losses do not change. The only thing that changes is that improts increase, together with tariff income. However, with a quota, the local price increases more. Hence, in a dynamic setup, tariffs and quota are no longer equivalent.\nWith an increasing demand: An import tariff implies more imports and a constant price, with an increase in government revenue. An import quota implies constant imports and an increase in prices, with a increase in quota-holders’ rents. Note: quantitive restrictions, like a quota, tend to remain constant over time in developing countries. Consequently, the import limitations becomes more stringent with time, and its pervasive effects more important. Imperfect competition and import quotas Suppose that the local market is served by a monopoly, Home is a small open economy that imports a good. Supose also that the government has introduced an import tariff at level $\\tau.$ What is the optimal behaviour of the monopolist? Since there are no restrictions in the number of goods that can be imported, the monopolist is forced by competition to charge a price equal to $p^w(1+\\tau).$ Otherwise, if he charged less, he would sell zero as all consumers would turn to imports. Also, the monopolist has no interest in selling at …","date":1562803200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562803200,"objectID":"ee477585374a82137c90376c0a058692","permalink":"https://example.com/courses/international_trade/non-tariff_barriers/","publishdate":"2019-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/international_trade/non-tariff_barriers/","section":"courses","summary":"Non-tariff barriers","tags":null,"title":"Non-tariff barriers","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Suppose now, instead, that a central planner is in charge of organising consumption and investment for all individuals.

Hence, whether public expenditures are financed using debt or taxes is irrelevant.\nIntuitively, forward-looking agents —who shall live forever– know that, if the government increases expenditures today without raising taxes, debt will be issued and taxes eventually increased to pay it off.\nHowever, as we shall see, in the OLG model, the Ricardian equivalence does not hold. Clearly, the main difference between the OLG and Ramsey models is that agents live only for two periods in the former. Suppose that the government decides to run a deficit today to increase public expenditures. Young and old individuals today are not that much affected because, when the government raises the taxes to pay the debt off, they would have already died. Instead, if the government decides to increase taxes today, it affects present-day young and old individuals.\nThe model with a government The government Suppose the government has public expenditures of $g_t$ per young individual. Total expenditures are then $G_t = N_t g_t.$ These public expenditures are financed by a lump-sum tax of $\\tau_t$, which is paid only by the young.

The government pays interest on the debt of the previous period: $R_t B_{t-1}.$\nWe can write the government’s budget constraint:\n$$G_t + R_t B_{t-1} = B_t + T_t.$$\nThe constraint, expressed in per capita terms, is:\n$$\\frac{G_t}{N_t} + R_t \\frac{B_{t-1}}{N_t} = \\frac{B_t}{N_t} + \\frac{T_t}{N_t} = $$ $$g_t + R_t \\underbrace{\\frac{B_{t-1}}{N_{t-1}}}_{b_{t-1}}\\underbrace{\\frac{N_{t-1}}{N_{t}}}_{\\frac{1}{1+n}} = b_t + \\tau_t = $$ $$g_t + R_t \\frac{b_{t-1}}{1+n} = b_t + \\tau_t $$\nAs a final note, government spending is unproductive: it does not affect the production function. Moreover, individuals do not derive utility from it. Finally, we assume that the government always honors its debt. In that sense, government debt is a riskless asset.\nIndividuals The budget constraint of a young individual who now pays taxes $\\tau_t$ is:\n$$w_t = c_t + s_t + \\tau_t$$ $$R_{t+1}s_t = d_{t+1}.$$\nAlternatively, we can express it as an intertemporal budget constraint:\n$$w_t = c_t + \\tau_t +\\frac{d_{t+1}}{R_{t+1}}.$$\nWe can easily obtain the savings function as we did before by substitution:\n$$\\max_{c_t, s_t, d_{t+1}} u(c_t) + \\beta u(d_{t+1})$$ $$\\mathrm{s.t.}, w_t = c_t + s_t - \\tau_t$$ $$\\phantom{\\mathrm{s.t.}}, d_{t+1} = R_{t+1}s_t.$$\nThen:\n$$\\max_{s_t} u(w_t-s_t-\\tau_t) + \\beta u(R_{t+1}s_t).$$\nThe first order condition reads:\n$$u^\\prime(w_t - s_t-\\tau_t) = \\beta R_{t+1} u^\\prime(R_{t+1}s_t).$$\nFrom here, we can recover the savings function:\n$$s_t = s(w_t-\\tau_t, R_{t+1}).$$\nIn this model, households have access to two types of savings:\nsavings in capital and government bonds. Moreover, the risk of both types of investment is the same: none, because both assets are riskless. Hence, bonds and capital are perfect substitutes. in the portfolio of wealth owners.1 Therefore, the entire amount households decide to save is split between the two\n$$N_t s_t = K_{t+1} + N_t b_t.$$\nEquilibrium At the (temporal) equilibrium , the government chooses $B_t, \\tau_t$ to satisfy its budget constraint: $g_t + R_t \\frac{b_{t-1}}{1+n} = b_t + \\tau_t.$ Moreover, as we have already discussed, because debt and capital are substitutes, both bear the same interest $R.$ Also, firms operate in a perfectly competitive environment and factors are paid their marginal productivities:\n$$w_t = \\omega(k_t)$$\nand $$R\\_t = f^\\prime(k\\_t)$$ with $k\\_t \\equiv \\frac{K\\_t}{N\\_t}.$ Introducing this into the government budget constraint we obtain:\n$$B_t + N_t \\tau_t = G_t + f^\\prime(\\color{red}{k_t})B_{t-1}.$$\nWe have implicitly assumed that investment is positive, this is, $$K_{t+1} = N_t s_t - B_t = N_t s(w_t - \\tau_t, R_{t+1}) - B_t \u0026gt;0.$$\nCapital thus evolves:\n$$K_{t+1} = N_t s_t - N_t b_t \\implies k_{t+1} = \\frac{1}{1+n} s(\\omega(k_t)-\\tau_t, R(k_{t+1})) - b_t.$$\nConstant deficit policy To simplify the analysis, we assume that the government faces constant expenditures $g_t = g$ and that the number of bonds is also constant: $b_t = b.$ The government can adjust the tax rate $\\tau_t$ each period. Therefore, the deficit at time $t$ is given by:\n$$\\mathcal{d}_t \\equiv g - \\tau_t = b\\left(1-\\frac{R_t}{1+n}\\right) = b\\left(\\frac{n+\\delta - r_t}{1+n}\\right),$$\nwhere we have used $R_t = 1 + r_t - \\delta$ together with the budget constraint of the government evaluated when $g_{t}=g$ and $b_{t}=b:$\n$$g + \\frac{b}{1+n}R_{t} = \\tau_{t} + b \\implies g - \\tau_{t} = b\\left(1-\\frac{R_{t}}{1+n}\\right).$$\nIf $n + \\delta \u0026gt; r_t$, then the government can be perpetually indebted while running a public deficit $g-\\tau_t.$ Otherwise, if $n + …","date":1562803200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562803200,"objectID":"5c8e72a422b1cdc7055570ba8b1f9bc8","permalink":"https://example.com/courses/macroeconomics/olg/olg_government/","publishdate":"2019-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/macroeconomics/olg/olg_government/","section":"courses","summary":"Based on de la Croix and Michel, Chapter 4.4\nThe Ricardian equivalence The Ricardian equivalence states that forward-looking agents internalise the government’s budget constraint when deciding.

However, what we claimed was that the entire path was optimal. We can prove it by solving the Ramsey allocation problem from the perspective of the social planner.\nSocial planner A social planner maximises total welfare, given by:\n$$\\max \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\beta^{t} u(c_{t}).$$\nThe social planner directly allocates resources between consumption and investment, so he is not bothered by wages or interest rates. In particular, he has to allocate total production and capital net of depreciation between $c_{t}$ and $k_{t+1}.$ Hence his intertemporal budget constraint reads:\n$$f(k_{t}) = c_{t} + k_{t+1} + (1-\\delta) k_{t}.$$ The planner operates under a certain level $k_{0} \u0026gt; 0$ given.\nThe budget constraint is equivalent to the one we found in the competitive equilibrium. Moreover, total welfare coincides, with household’s utility. Hence, the solutions will be the same, proving that the competitive equilibrium was optimal.\nThe two main equations of the model are relevant for the planner as well. First, he must follow the Euler equation. In fact, he can reduce present consumption by $\\Delta c$ at time $t$ and save it. The present-day cost is $u^{\\prime} ( c_{t} ) \\Delta_{c}$. He obtains $f^{\\prime}(k_t) \\Delta_{c} + (1-\\delta) \\Delta_{c}$ at time $t+1,$ which raises utility by $\\left( f^{\\prime}(k_{t}) \\Delta_{c} + (1-\\delta) \\Delta_{c} \\right) u^{\\prime}_{c_{t+1}}.$ Optimality implies that this trade off is not possible anymore, hence, we obtain the Euler equation again.\nSecond, although the planner directly allocates consumption and investments, he must follow the technological constraint displayed above. This does not represent preferences, and coincides with the household’s budget constraint after clearing the markets.\nFinally, observe that the first welfare theorem directly applies: if markets are competitive and there are no externalities, then the decentralised equilibrium is Pareto-efficient. All conditions hold in the Ramsey model.\nThe Golden rule We have discussed before that, in the Ramsey model, the economy converges to a steady state with $\\bar{k}$ below the Golden-rule level of capital $k^{\\mathcal{GR}}$.\nThis contrasts with the Solow model: in the Solow model, a sufficiently high saving rate causes capital over-accumulation. This opens the possibility of finding alternative paths that yield higher consumption levels in each and every period —meaning that such a saving rate was not Pareto-efficient.\nIn the Ramsey model, savings are optimally derived from utility maximisation, and the level of utility depends on consumption. Moreover, the model features no externalities. Consequently, the model cannot produce a situation whereby it is possible to increase consumption at each and every period: this would contradict optimisation.\nHowever, $\\bar{k} \u0026lt; k^{\\mathcal{GR}}$ implies that it is possible to increase the saving rate today, build up the extra capital needed to reach $k^{\\mathcal{GR}}$ and then be able to consume $c^{\\mathcal{GR}} \u0026gt; \\bar{c}$ at the steady state —which, remember, lasts forever. Suppose that we had reached the steady-state. Why do the households not change their saving rate to reach $c^{\\mathcal{GR}}?$ The reason is that households value present consumption more than future consumption. Therefore, the current utility cost of a reduction in consumption is larger the future gains once discounted. Because of the discount rate, the utility gains from an eventual permanent increase in consumption are bounded.\nAll in all, the economy converges to a value $\\bar{k}$ below the steady state. Because $\\bar{k}$ is the optimal level of $k$ for the economy to converge to, it is known as the modified Golden-rule capital stock.\nWe had already noticed that the discount factor $\\beta$ prevents the economy from reaching the Golden-rule level of capital. According to our computation, the Golden-rule level of capital is only attained if $\\beta = 1.$ This implies that present and future consumption are valued the same, which complements the discussion above.\n","date":1562803200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562803200,"objectID":"62bea2e700dbffac1ed1a56eb38a0ce9","permalink":"https://example.com/courses/macroeconomics/ramsey/ramsey_remarks/","publishdate":"2019-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/macroeconomics/ramsey/ramsey_remarks/","section":"courses","summary":"Optimality Before we claimed that the solution is optimal despite the fact that it does not maximise consumption at the steady state.

While Tikopians managed to control population growth and natural resources usage, the inhabitants of Eastern Island engaged in clan competition for the control of resources, leading to overpopulation and overexplotation of resources.\nA key aspect of this paper is the especial role of fertility. Most papers assume that parents derive some utility from having children. However, in de la Croix and Dottori, fertility is the result of a Nash bargaining process for the control of resources. In particular, a larger population, facilitated by having more children, raises the value of the fallback option during the negotiation process. Consequently, individuals optimally decide to have more children, because this implies a better bargaining position. In this sense, equilibrium-level fertility rates result from the complementarities between different groups’ fertility decisions. However, the externalities of a higher fertiltiy rate are not internalised and, in the long run, population explodes, leading to a natural catastrophe.\nHistorical data Based on data from archaeological studies, it has been estimated that the population of Eastern Island increased very little between 400CE (100 people by that time) and 110CE, and from then on, it exploded, reaching 10000 people during 1400-1600CE. The effects of the population race could be perceived by 1600CE: food consumption declined and population plummeted during the 17th century. By 1772, when Europeans arrived at Eastern Island, the total population was around 3000 people. In parallel, data about forests in Eastern Island indicate that upon the arrival of the first settlers during 400CE, tree-cutting begun. By 1400CE, deforestation had reached its peak and when the Europeans arrived, there were basically no trees in the island. Meanwhile, Tikopia was settled around 900BCE and people lived by slash and burn agriculture. By 100BCE, due to decreasing returns from natural resources, pig breeding began, lasting until the 17th century, when Tikopians abandoned it because pigs required too many resources. Total population stabilized at around 1200 people and was kept at that level by purposeful mechanisms: celibacy, abortion, infanticide, sea exploration by young males, etc.\nThe model De la Croix and Dottori work using the OLG framework. In the paper, agents live for two periods. However, important decisions are taken at the clan level, which acts as a representative agent. Clans (and individuals) are rational, have perfect foresight and take the actions of the other clans as given. The timing is as follows:\nEach clan chooses its fertility level, A Nash-Cournot fertility equilibrium level arises, Crops are cultivated and shared between clans following a non-cooperative bargaining process. For simplicity, the island is populated by two opposed clans, all individuals belong to one clan only and they cannot change clan.\nPreferences Clan $i$ at time $t$ consists of $N_{i,t}$ adults. Adults work, support their parents and have children. Old agents only consume what their children provide for them.1 Total utility is given by: $$U_{i,t} = c_{i,t} + \\beta d_{i,t+1},$$ where $c_{i,t}, d_{i,t+1}$ represents consumption when adult and old, respectively.\nBudget The income of an adult agent is $y_{i,t}$. Each adult has to support his parents by giving them some resources. However, support for parents is not linear, but rather it depends on the number of siblings. In particular, each sibling contributes the following share of his income: $$\\frac{\\tau}{1+n_{i,t-1}},$$ where $\\tau \\in (0,1)$. Clearly, the contribution decreases with the number of siblings.\nConsequently, an agent in his old age who had $n_{i,t}$ children receives, as total old age support, $$d_{i,t+1} = n_{i,t}\\frac{\\tau}{1+n_{i,t}}y_{i,t+1}.$$\nLastly, since total income is distributed between consumption and supporting parents $\\left(y_{i,t} = c_{i,t} + \\frac{\\tau}{1+n_{i,t-1}} y_{i,t}\\right)$, consumption when young is just: $$c_{i,t} = \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\tau}{1+n_{i,t-1}}\\right)y_{i,t}.$$\nPopulation The population of each clan evolves according to the chosen fertility level: $$N_{i,t+1} = N_{i,t}n_{i,t}.$$\nProduction Production depends only on land. The amount of land is fixed at $L$, and total factor productivity depends on the available natural resources $R_t$. $$Y_{i,t} = A(R_t)L.$$\nThe dynamics of resources follow the paper by Matsumoto (2002): $$R_{t+1} = \\left(1 +\\delta - \\delta \\frac{R_t}{K} - b (N_{1,t} + N_{2,t})\\right)R_t,$$ where $K \u0026gt; 0$ is the carrying capacity (maximum possible number of resources), $\\delta \u0026gt; 0$ is the growth rate of resources while $b\u0026gt;0$ measures the effect of population on resources.\nCrop-sharing We denote by $\\theta_t$ the share of crops $Y_t$ that Group 1 appropriates.

The papers undefined that the demise of the class structure was a deliberate action from the part of the capitalists to sustain their profits as human capital became more and more important in the production process. This is, at some point in time, human capital becomes really necessary to produce, and the capitalists find it optimal to tax themselves to finance the education of workers. Doing so, raises the human capital level and allows them to keep their profits.\nThe paper is set-up after the industrial revolution, let’s say around 1850 and is meant to describe the transition of the modern economies between that time and the beginning of the 20th century. The authors motivate the paper by showing that during this time, school enrolment rates increased while, at the same time, inequality decreased: the demise of classes. The theory the authors propose parallels this evolution. Furthermore, they supplement the model with econometrics that are compatible with the predictions of the model. The model We present a simplified version of the model using precise functional forms for the human capital accumulation process and the production function. This paper comprises two separate sections:\nThe general model The application of the model to a society with two classes. We will follow this approach. For the moment, the economy comprises only one type of individuals. Individuals live for two periods of time: young and adult. Young individuals do not produce and use their time to acquire human capital. If education is provided, human capital accumulation is faster.\nProduction and prices A single homogenous good is produced using physical and human capital according to a Cobb-Douglas production function. In particular:\n$$Y_t = F(H_t, K_t) = A K_t^\\alpha H_t^{1-\\alpha} = A H_t k_t^\\alpha,\\quad k_t \\equiv \\frac{K_t}{H_t}.$$\nGiven the wage rate per efficiency unit of labour $w_t$ and the return to capital $r_t$, producers maximise profits by choosing the level of capital $K_t$ and efficiency units of labour $H_t,$ this is, $\\{K_t, H_t\\} = \\arg \\max \\left[A H_t k_t^\\alpha - w_t H_t - r_t K_t\\right].$ Considering perfect competition, the inverse demand for each factor is:\n$$r_t = f^\\prime(k_t) = \\alpha A k_t^{\\alpha-1} = r(k_t),$$ $$w_t = f(k_t) - f^\\prime(k_t)k_t = (1-\\alpha)Ak_t^\\alpha = w(k_t).$$\nIndividuals and preferences Every period, a new generation of size 1 is born. Individuals have only parent and each has only one son. Individuals live for two periods: during their youth, they accumulate human capital; and education improves human capital accumulation. Young individuals may receive a positive bequest from their parents on which they earn interests (the bequest is physical capital that is lent to producers). When adults, they supply their human capital as efficiency units of labour; receive interests on their assets and allocate the total income between consumption and a bequest.\nThe bequest $b_t$ is transferred from parents to children, and the government collects a tax $\\tau_t \\geq 0$ on it. The remaining $1-\\tau_t$ is saved for future consumption. Physical capital fully depreciates between periods.\nAs mentioned, individuals accumulate human capital during their youth, and if they are provided with education ($e_t$), human capital accumulation is enhanced. However, even if no education is provided, all young individuals manage to obtain a minimum level of human capital: we set it equal to one. We model human capital accumulation as follows:1\n$$h_{t+1} = 1 + \\frac{e_t}{1+e_t} = h(e_t).$$\nThis type of function ensures that under some conditions, investment in education is not optimal; while guaranteeing a minimum level of human capital.\nWhen adults, individuals receive wages on their human capital, as well as the rental price on the bequest (the part not taxed by the government). Therefore, an individual with a bequest $b_t$ and education level $e_t$ has income equal to:\n$$I^i_{t+1} = w_{t+1}h(e_t) + (1-\\tau)b^i_t R_{t+1},$$ and, since capital fully depreciates, $R_{t+1} = r_{t+1} = r(k_{t+1}).$\nLastly, the preferences of adults include consumption and a taste for giving bequests. Bequests in the model are a type of luxury good: only when income is large enough, $b_t \u0026gt; 0.$ In particular: $$u^i_t = (1-\\beta) \\log (c^i_{t+1}) + \\beta \\log (\\bar{\\theta} + b^i_{t+1}),$$ where $\\bar{\\theta} \u0026gt; 0$ and $\\beta \\in (0,1).$ The budget constraint is simple: $$c_{t+1}^i + b_{t+1}^i = I_{t+1}^i.$$\nOptimisation We can easily compute the value of bequests, as a function of the income level.

This is important for development, because those who save more are the individuals who are more patient, this is, who are more future-oriented. Although the major contribution of the paper is empirical, the authors develop an OLG model from which they derive implications that are tested.\nThe theoretical model shows how the composition of a population can be modeled using the OLG framework. The most influential model in that regard is Bisin, A., \u0026amp; Verdier, T. (2001). The Economics of Cultural Transmission and the Dynamics of Preferences. Journal of Economic Theory, 97(2), 298–319. However, the model in Galor and Özak is relatively simple and illustrates well some population dynamics.\nThe model We work under the OLG framework, and we assume that the economy is agricultural and at the very early stages of development. In every period, the economy consists of individuals who live for three periods.\nDuring the first period of life, individuals are children and are economically passive. Consumption during this period is provided by parents. In the second period and third periods, individuals work All individuals can choose between two modes of production: Endowment mode: it provides an equal pay-off during the second and third periods of live. For instance, individuals may be hunters. Investment mode: it pays little during the second period of live, but the pay-off during the third period is much larger. This represents farmers: they must seed and wait for crops to grow. Lastly, a crucial assumption of the mode is the lack of financial markets and long-term storage technology. This implies that individuals cannot transfers consumption between periods two and three. Hence, production in the second period has to be consumed in the second period; and consumption in the third period must be consumed in the third period.\nProduction modes All adults must decide between the endowment mode or the investment mode. The endowment mode provides a constant level of output,$R^0\u0026gt;1$ in each of the working periods. If investment is instead chosen, it requires an investment during the first working period, which implies that less resources are available for consumption. In particular, we assume that it leaves individuals with $1$ unit of consumption during their second period of life. However, the output it yields during the third period $R^1$ is higher than under endowment: $\\ln(R^1) \u0026gt; 2 \\ln (R^0).$\nFinally, depending on the chosen production mode, the income of individual $i$ is given by: $$(y_{i,t}, y_{i,t+1}) = \\begin{cases} (R^0, R^0) \u0026amp; \\mathrm{if\\, endowment} \\\\\\ (1, R^1) \u0026amp; \\mathrm{if\\, investment} \\end{cases}.$$\nPreferences A key aspect of the model to generate dynamics in the evolution of individual traits is the fertility decision. This approach is common: typically, fertility is linked to a trait through income. This is, individuals with more income will be able to have more children. If the trait is transmitted from parents to children, then the trait that allows generating more income will become more and more prevalent in the economy.1 In any case, preferences are really important in this type of models, because fertility decisions are derived from them.\nEvery period $t$, a generation of size $L_t$ becomes economically active, this is, reaches the second period of life. Those individuals were born in period $t-1$. At this stage, each individual will live for two periods. Remember that financial markets do not exist, and also that it is impossible to transfer resources between periods by storing them.\nWe assume that, during the second period of life, individuals only consume what they produce. Lastly, during the third and last period individuals consume and also have children. In particular, utility is given by: $$u^{i,t} = \\ln c_{i,t} + \\beta^i_t [\\gamma \\ln n_{i,t+1} + (1-\\gamma) \\ln c_{i,t+1}],\\quad \\gamma \\in(0,1),$$ where $c_{i,t}$ and $c_{i,t+1}$ are the levels of consumption in the second and third periods of life and $n_{i,t}$ is the number of children. It is important to comment on $\\beta^i_t \\in (0,1]$: it represents individual i’s discount factor, this is, how much he values the future with respect to the present. The larger $\\beta^i_t$, the more the value of future and, hence, the more patient the individual is. Notice that $\\beta^i_t$ changes over time and also by individual.\nDuring the second period, individuals do not really make any decision: since resources cannot be transferred, all production must be consumed. Hence, $c_{i,t} = y_{i,t}$. However, during the last period individuals can trade-off utility from consumption and utility from children.

It proposes and empirically assesses a new class of determinants of gender equality: increases in women's bargaining power through reductions in the cost of remaining single. In particular, enlarging women's options besides marriage —even if only temporarily— increases their bargaining power with respect to men, leading to a persistent improvement in gender equality. We illustrate this mechanism focusing on the specific Belgian context, and relate gender-equality levels in the 19th century to the presence of medieval, female-only communities called _beguinages_ that allowed women to remain single amidst a society that advocated the opposite. Combining precise beguinages' location with 19th-century census data, we document that beguinages were instrumental in decreasing the gender gap in literacy.","tags":["Gender Equality","Economic History","Empirical Work"],"title":"","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Èric Roca Fernández","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

We hypothesise that exposure to rare natural events drives curiosity and prompts thinking in an attempt to comprehend and explain the phenomenon, thus raising human capital. We focus on solar eclipses as one particular trigger of curiosity and empirically establish a robust relationship between their number and several proxies for economic prosperity: social complexity, technological level and population density. Variation in solar eclipse exposure is exogenous as their local incidence is randomly and sparsely distributed all over the globe. Additionally, eclipses’ non-destructive character makes them outperform other uncanny natural events, such as volcano eruptions or earthquakes, which have a direct negative economic effects. We also offer evidence compatible with the human capital increase we postulate, finding a more intricate thinking in ethnic groups more exposed to solar eclipses. In particular, we study the development of written language, the playing of strategy games and the accuracy of the folkloric reasoning for eclipses.","tags":["Comparative Development","Economic History","Empirical Work"],"title":"Celestial Enlightenment: Eclipses, curiosity and economic development among pre-modern ethnic groups","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Annalisa Frigo","Èric Roca Fernández"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1575909000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575909000,"objectID":"be5784ba5b43436f2d39f713688290fa","permalink":"https://example.com/talk/roots-of-gender-equality-the-persistent-effect-of-beguinages-on-attitudes-toward-women/","publishdate":"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/roots-of-gender-equality-the-persistent-effect-of-beguinages-on-attitudes-toward-women/","section":"event","summary":"This papers shows the long-lasting effects of the beguine movement on gender equality.

To empirically test our hypothesis we exploit variations in the exposure to solar eclipses in a set of 1267 ethnic groups derived from Murdock’s Ethnographic Atlas. Variation in the exposure to total eclipses is exogenous, as eclipses are randomly and sparsely distributed all over the globe, while unlike other natural phenomena, solar eclipses are not associated with any capital destruction. We proxy for social complexity using several different measures: i) the presence of high gods; ii) jurisdictional hierarchy beyond local community; iii) level of political integration; iv) existence of strategy games; and v) class stratification. Our results are robust to a wide range of geographical and ethnic group controls as well as to a horce-race regression between solar and lunar eclipses. As a potential mechanism we hypothesize that solar ecplipses and the fear instilled by them is associated with higher levels of critical thinking, in an attempt to comprehend and eventually control the natural environment. This allows, in turn, better and more complex strategies to use the resources and to cope with changes.","tags":[],"title":"The Terror of History: Solar Eclipses and the Origins of Critical Thinking and Complexity","type":"event"},{"authors":["Èric Roca Fernández"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1561075200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561075200,"objectID":"cf692777fbb1cbafd88d423f4f0df7fa","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/inheritance-systems/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/inheritance-systems/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper examines how the degree of gender-egalitarianism embedded in inheritance rules impacts state building.
