      <title>In the Name of the Father: Inheritance Systems and the Dynamics of State Capacity</title>

      <description>&lt;strong&gt;Accepted at &lt;em&gt;Macroeconomic Dynamics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;br&gt; This paper examines how the degree of gender-egalitarianism embedded in inheritance rules impacts state building. Male-biased inheritance rules historically maximise the likelihood of dynastic continuity. However, there is more land merging under gender-egalitarian rules. We compare both types of inheritance rules, concluding that, contrary to the literature, gender-egalitarian norms promote state capacity in the short run more than gender-biased norms. In the long run results are reversed.</description>

      <description>This papers shows the long-lasting effects of the beguine movement on gender equality. Beguinages were female-only, semi-religious institutions that appeared in the Low Countries during the Middle Ages. We find that, during the 19th century, female wages and literacy rates were closer to their male counterparts in municipalities that had a beguinage.</description>

      <description>We analyse how inheritance rules affect rulers&amp;rsquo; willingness to invest in state capacity. We find that rules that privelege men over women generate higher levels of state capacity in the long run.</description>

      <title>If Children Suffer when Mothers Work, Do They Work Less?</title>

      <description>This paper proposes child mortality differentials between working and non-working mothers as a determinant of female labour force participation. For sub-Saharan Africa, we find that, indeed, the mortality gradient is taken into account at the family level when deciding woman&amp;rsquo;s involvement in the labour market. The effects appear relevant mostly for well-off families.</description>

      <description>&lt;strong&gt;Awarded the &amp;lsquo;UWIN Best Paper Award on Gender Economics&amp;rsquo;, 7th edition.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Awarded a &amp;lsquo;Valeria Solesin&amp;rsquo; accessit, 2018 edition.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt; This paper is concerned with the historical roots of gender equality. It proposes and empirically assesses a new class of determinants of gender equality: increases in women&amp;rsquo;s bargaining power through reductions in the cost of remaining single. In particular, enlarging women&amp;rsquo;s options besides marriage &amp;mdash;even if only temporarily&amp;mdash; increases their bargaining power with respect to men, leading to a persistent improvement in gender equality. We illustrate this mechanism focusing on the specific Belgian context, and relate gender-equality levels in the 19th century to the presence of medieval, female-only communities called &lt;em&gt;beguinages&lt;/em&gt; that allowed women to remain single amidst a society that advocated the opposite. Combining precise beguinages&amp;rsquo; location with 19th-century census data, we document that beguinages were instrumental in decreasing the gender gap in literacy.</description>
