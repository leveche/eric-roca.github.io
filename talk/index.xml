      <description>This papers shows the long-lasting effects of the beguine movement on gender equality. Beguinages were female-only, semi-religious institutions that appeared in the Low Countries during the Middle Ages. We find that, during the 19th century, female wages and literacy rates were closer to their male counterparts in municipalities that had a beguinage.</description>

      <title>If Children Suffer when Mothers Work, Do They Work Less?</title>

      <description>This paper proposes child mortality differentials between working and non-working mothers as a determinant of female labour force participation. For sub-Saharan Africa, we find that, indeed, the mortality gradient is taken into account at the family level when deciding woman&amp;rsquo;s involvement in the labour market. The effects appear relevant mostly for well-off families.</description>
