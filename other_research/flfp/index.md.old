abstract = "This paper studies a new determinant of female employment in the context of developing countries. Using data from sub-Saharan regions, it advances that maternal job-taking varies with the mortality risk premium it poses to children. Reductions in maternal employment are sizeable and reach 5.6 percentage points among affluent families in more developed areas. We do not find such evidence among poor households, suggesting financial constraints may impede trading off maternal income against children safety. The effect we document applies only to families with under-five infants. We introduce a theoretical model rationalising our findings. It also generates a Ushaped relationship between economic prosperity and female employment." 

abstract_short = "This paper proposes child mortality differentials between working and non-working mothers as a determinant of female labour force participation. For sub-Saharan Africa, we find that, indeed, the mortality gradient is taken into account at the family level when deciding woman's involvement in the labour market. The effects appear relevant mostly for well-off families."
